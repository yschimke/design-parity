/**
 * The conformance runner for `compose-preview-known-differences/v1`.
 *
 * This is the deliverable batch 04 exists for: a committed, language-neutral fixture set plus a
 * runner that fails loudly, so batch 05's two engines have something to be measured against on day
 * one rather than a prose description to interpret. The same device already keeps
 * `parity-activity.mjs` and `ServeParityActivityStore` honest — one committed fixture, two
 * languages, both tests load it.
 *
 * **The fixtures are the contract; this file is one of its three runners.** The other two are
 * `design-parity`'s own suite and the server projector's Kotlin tests, and neither can be written
 * against a runner that quietly reinterprets the fixture tree. So everything here reads the tree the
 * way any runtime would: `case.json` for the comparison and the catalog, `known-differences.json`
 * for the document, `artifacts/<id>/…` for the rasters, `expected.json` for the verdict. No
 * JavaScript-shaped assumptions are baked into the directory layout.
 *
 * `expected.json` is a **partial** pin, and its `pins` array says which keys are normative. A key
 * listed there must match exactly; a key that is absent is not pinned by any batch *yet* — the score
 * stages (`raw` / `accepted` / `unaccepted`) are the ones batch 05 adds, over these same cases.
