/**
 * The conformance runner for the separated-plane score — batch 05's half of
 * `compose-preview-known-differences/v1`.
 *
 * Split from `known-differences.test.mjs` for the same reason the fixtures are: the gate cases are
 * handed canonical planes and no source rasters, so they have nothing to score, and the scoring
 * cases start from a *given* surviving union rather than re-deriving it. A divergence then fails at
 * the stage that caused it, which is the whole point of paying for intermediate pins at all.
 *
 * As in the gate suite, the fixture tree is read the way any runtime would read it — `case.json` for
 * the geometry and the masks, `expected.json` for the verdict and which of its keys are normative —
 * so `design-parity`'s suite and the server's Kotlin tests can be written against it unchanged.
