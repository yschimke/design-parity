# `known-differences/` — conformance fixtures for `compose-preview-known-differences/v1`

**Generated. Do not hand-edit — run `node build-known-difference-fixtures.mjs` instead.**
The recipe for every byte here is in that script, so a reviewer checks a fixture by reading how
it was built rather than a hex dump.

The contract these pin is
[`COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md` §4](../../../../docs/design/COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md#the-normative-contract).
**One runtime reads it today** — this repo's `known-differences.test.mjs`. Two more are *intended*
consumers, and neither exists yet: `design-parity`'s own suite and the server projector's Kotlin
tests, both batch 05's work. The layout assumes no language so those two can be written against it
unchanged, but until they exist this tree has single-runtime coverage, and a divergence only the
Kotlin engine would show is caught by nothing here. Saying so is the point: a README describing
three live runners would let exactly that drift pass for cross-runtime agreement.

## A case

```
cases/<case-id>/
  case.json                  # the comparison, the catalog for the orphan walk, synthesis recipes
  known-differences.json     # the document under test (raw text, so `document-unreadable` is reachable)
  artifacts/<id>/mask.png    # `.design-parity/known-differences/<id>/` stands in here
  artifacts/<id>/accepted-candidate.png
  expected.json              # the verdict, and which of its keys are normative
rasters/<sha-prefix>.png     # shared canonical-plane inputs named by each case's comparison
```

`expected.json` is a **partial** pin: its `pins` array names the keys a runner must check. A key
listed there must match exactly; a key that is absent is not pinned by any batch *yet*. The score
stages — `raw`, `accepted`, `unaccepted` — live in their own `scoring/` group rather than on every
case here: a gate case is handed canonical planes and no source rasters, so it has nothing to
score, and spreading the scoring path across sixty gate cases would report a scorer divergence as
sixty wrong verdicts.

Canonical-plane rasters are shared under `rasters/`; their paths in `case.json` are relative to
this fixture root, while artifact paths remain relative to their acceptance's case directory
because artifact path resolution is part of the contract under test. The canonical rasters still
arrive **already resampled**, deliberately. The portable kernel has its own group under `resample/`,
so a resampler divergence fails there rather than surfacing as a wrong
verdict in sixty gate cases at once — which is the entire reason for pinning intermediate stages.

`synthesize` is how a case expresses a file too big to commit: pad the named base file to `padTo`
bytes. The padding goes **inside the compressed stream** — empty stored deflate blocks and
zero-length `IDAT` chunks — so the artifact stays a PNG a strict decoder accepts and decodes to
exactly the image its base does, and the only thing the recipe changes is the encoded byte length.
Appending bytes after `IEND` would be cheaper and wrong: `IEND` ends the datastream, so anything
after it bypasses the chunk allowlist, the placement rules and every CRC.

**The artifact reader has to serve a prefix.** The header pass asks for at most the first 4096
bytes of each artifact and expects those bytes plus the *whole* file's length back; the decode
pass asks for the file. A runner that ignores the request and returns whole files passes almost
everything here — `header-invalid-chunk-longer-than-the-prefix` is the case that catches it, and
`artifact-header-region-at-the-conforming-maximum` is the one that catches a prefix sized too
small. The full length matters as much as the prefix: it is what the 8 MiB cap is measured
against, so a runner substituting the length it happened to serve has a cap that no longer
applies to anything.

## The pilot population

Measured rather than assumed, and smaller and more awkward than a dozen known differences
suggests: **four issues across six sites**, of which exactly one is the shape the model was drawn
around. Each has a case here.

| Site | Mask | Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| m3-catalog#40 `IconButton/Tonal` | a glyph — the worked example | `pilot-40-iconbutton-tonal-glyph` |
| m3-catalog#41 `NavigationBar/Short` | most of the bar | `pilot-41-navigationbar-short` |
| m3-catalog#87 `Checkbox/Checked` | a 2dp ring around a 20dp box | `pilot-87-checkbox-checked-ring` |
| m3-catalog#42 ×3 (`Button/`, `Card/`, `ToggleButton/Elevated`) | a shadow surrounding each component | `pilot-42-elevated-shadow-trio` |

#89 and #93 are indexable and have nothing to accept, which is why the two counts name different
issues — six issues can carry a locator, four are acceptance candidates.

## The resampler

| Case | What it pins |
| --- | --- |
| `downscale-2x1-average` | Four pixels averaged into one |
| `rounding-exactly-half` | An average landing exactly on .5 |
| `downscale-non-integer-ratio` | Three pixels into two — partial footprints |
| `downscale-non-integer-ratio-vertical` | Three rows into two — the same partial footprints, on the other axis |
| `downscale-non-integer-ratio-both-axes` | Three by three into two by two — a genuinely two-dimensional footprint |
| `upscale-integer-ratio` | Two pixels into four |
| `upscale-non-integer-ratio` | Two pixels into three — the upscale that does not reduce to nearest-neighbour |
| `rounding-half-survives-the-ratio` | An exact half that floating-point footprints lose |
| `alpha-is-a-fourth-channel` | Alpha averaged without premultiplication |

## Sub-pixel rounding

Outward, to the enclosing integer box. Its own group because every gate case is handed canonical
boxes that are already integers — without these, a second engine could round inward or to nearest
and still pass the whole suite.

| Case | What it pins |
| --- | --- |
| `integer-box-is-unchanged` | A box already on the grid |
| `fractional-origin-floors` | A fractional origin |
| `fractional-far-edge-ceils` | A fractional far edge |
| `fractional-both-ends` | Fractional at both ends |
| `negative-origin` | A box whose origin is negative |

## The separated-plane score

Batch 05's half. A scoring case starts from the **surviving union** — the masks of the
acceptances that reached `valid` — because which ones survive is the gates' answer and `cases/`
already pins it. The two halves meet at the `survivingMaskIds` pin, which is what makes
"a `resolved` mask suppresses nothing" a property two fixtures establish between them rather
than one that asserts its own premise.

```
scoring/<case-id>/
  case.json                  # the two boxes, the recorded plane, and the surviving masks
  reference.png              # the full SOURCE rasters — the score resamples from these (I10),
  candidate.png              # not from the canonical plane, which is for the gates
  masks/*.png                # one per surviving acceptance, in the canonical plane
  expected.json              # scorePlane, presence, samples, scores — and which are normative
```

Every case is built from flat rectangles, so the metric collapses to `pixelCost(|Δluma|)` per
coordinate over a denominator that can be counted — which is what lets `expected.json` state each
number as arithmetic rather than as whatever the implementation produced. `epsilon` is there
because a luminance is a float dot product: an engine agreeing on the algorithm lands within a
double's rounding of the declared decimal, and an engine disagreeing about the algorithm misses
by orders of magnitude more.

| Case | What it pins |
| --- | --- |
| `masked-and-unmasked-are-scored-apart` | One mask, and three numbers that are each a mean anyone can check |
| `a-regression-beside-the-mask-is-still-charged` | A regression three pixels outside the mask edge, charged in full |
| `a-straddling-footprint-keeps-both-signals` | An accepted difference beside an opposite unaccepted one, reported as both |
| `an-all-masked-comparison-measures-nothing` | A mask covering the whole plane leaves `unaccepted` measuring nothing |
| `an-empty-union-leaves-raw-untouched` | With nothing accepted, `unaccepted` is `raw` bit for bit |
| `overlapping-masks-suppress-the-seam-once` | Two masks sharing four columns, whose union is one region |
| `two-encodings-of-one-edge-agree` | The same half-covered edge, encoded at two resolutions, is not a difference |
| `translucent-ink-still-shows-its-ground` | Two translucent sides differ by exactly the ground they let through |

## The canonical plane

Content-box detection is part of the portable path, not a host detail: the plane gate compares a
**recomputed** plane against the recorded one, so a one-pixel disagreement about a box is
`plane-changed` on one engine and `valid` on the other. Every gate case is handed its plane as an
input — deliberately, so it tests the gate — which leaves the measurement pinned by nothing at all
without this group.

| Case | What it pins |
| --- | --- |
| `an-opaque-sheet-crops-to-its-mark` | A white scaffold sheet with a mark inset on it |
| `an-unknown-opaque-corner-is-the-whole-image` | An opaque backdrop that is not a sheet the renderer paints |
| `alpha-decides-wherever-there-is-any` | A transparent capture, measured by its alpha |
| `a-blank-capture-has-no-box` | A capture with nothing drawn on it |
| `a-sliver-falls-back-to-the-full-canvas` | One side below `MIN_BOX_COVERAGE`, and both fall back |
| `the-sampling-downscale-is-the-portable-kernel` | A capture large enough to be downscaled before it is sampled |

## The tag index, projected

The index publishes `boundsInRoot` in **render pixels** and names that space on the wire; an
acceptance's `element.bounds` is its authoring-time baseline in the **canonical plane**. The
element gate compares the two directly, so the comparison converts — and §4 names the failure for
not converting: an engine that expects canonical bounds from the index reports `element-moved` for
an element that never moved. Pure geometry, so every expectation is derivable by hand.

| Case | What it pins |
| --- | --- |
| `an-uncropped-plane-is-the-identity` | A candidate box at the origin, the same size as the plane |
| `the-candidate-box-origin-is-subtracted` | A cropped candidate, whose content box does not start at the origin |

| `a-fractional-projection-rounds-outward` | A scale that lands the box off the integer grid |
| `a-negative-origin-clips-to-the-plane` | A tagged node reaching above and left of the content box |
| `a-box-outside-the-plane-keeps-its-count` | A tagged node that clips away entirely |
| `a-prototype-named-tag-stays-an-own-key` | A tag literally named `__proto__` |
