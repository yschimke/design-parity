 * The PNG **writer** — the half of the old `png-lite.mjs` that needs a compressor.
 *
 * Split out in batch 05 so its sibling can be bundled into `format-compare.js`. Reading a PNG is now
 * host-free (see [`inflate-lite.mjs`](./inflate-lite.mjs) and
 * [`sha256-lite.mjs`](./sha256-lite.mjs)), because the browser engine and the offline one must decode
 * the same bytes the same way or two consumers disagree about what a hash-valid artifact contains.
 * *Writing* has no such requirement: only the fixture generator writes a PNG, it runs on Node, and
 * `deflateSync` is both better at its job than anything worth hand-writing here and — more to the
 * point — already the encoder every committed byte in `fixtures/known-differences/` was produced
 * with. Replacing it would rewrite the whole tree's digests for no gain.
 *
 * So the rule is one line: **read in `png-lite.mjs`, write here.** Anything that imports this file
 * cannot run in a browser, and nothing that needs to should.
