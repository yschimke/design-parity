 * The comparison metric's tuning numbers, as the offline engines read them.
 *
 * **This is a mirror, and the mirror is enforced.** The browser's copy is
 * [`cli/serve-web/src/scorer/tuning.ts`](../../cli/serve-web/src/scorer/tuning.ts), which is where
 * each number's rationale is written down and which the live scorer actually imports. Every one of
 * them is load-bearing to the number that comes out — the bidirectional search at
 * `EDGE_SEARCH_RADIUS`, the `LUMA_TOLERANCE` floor and the `MAX_SIDE` cap decide what a comparison
 * reports — so two copies drifting apart is precisely the silent divergence
 * [§4](../../docs/design/COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md#two-engines-one-semantics) exists to prevent.
 *
 * `known-difference-score.test.mjs` reads the TypeScript file and asserts the two agree, value by
 * value. A constant added there and not here fails that test rather than surfacing months later as
 * an unexplained score difference between the browser and the offline run.
 *
 * A shared JSON file would remove the duplication outright and is the better end state; it is not
 * this batch's change, because `tuning.ts` is imported by the built browser bundle and moving it
 * touches the asset-freshness check that keeps the committed bundle honest.
