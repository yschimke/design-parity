/**
 * Content-box detection and the canonical plane, portably.
 *
 * The plane gate compares a **recomputed** plane against the one an acceptance recorded, so both
 * engines have to measure the same box from the same bytes — which makes content-box detection part
 * of the portable path rather than a host detail, exactly as
 * [§4's fixture-stage table](../../docs/design/COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md#two-engines-one-semantics)
 * says: *"content-box detection is itself part of the portable path and two engines can otherwise
 * measure differently near a sampled edge or the `MIN_BOX_COVERAGE` threshold"*. A one-pixel
 * disagreement there is not a rounding difference in a score; it is `plane-changed` on one engine
 * and `valid` on the other, from identical inputs.
 *
 * The **decisions** below — sheet-or-whole-image, alpha before colour, widen by one sample cell, the
 * coverage fallback — are `cli/serve-web/src/scorer/contentBox.ts`'s, unchanged, and its comments are
 * where the reasoning for each lives. What this file changed was the one host-dependent step: the
 * sampling downscale is the portable area average rather than `drawImage`, whose filter is not
 * reproducible off-browser.
 *
 * **The browser's own `contentBox` measures through the same kernel as of the D3 rebaseline.** It
 * used not to: the two were measuring the same picture through two resamplers, so they agreed on
 * any box whose edges were not within a sample cell of a partially-covered pixel and could differ by
 * one there. `cli/serve-web/src/scorer/frames.ts` now samples with {@link resampleArea} too, which
 * is what closed that gap — and the acceptance path still uses *this* function on both engines
 * rather than whichever one the host has, because a host that later changed its mind would be the
 * failure this module exists to prevent.
 */

// the contract; this file is a second consumer of them rather than a second copy.

 * The element gate compares the two directly, so somebody has to convert — and D1 settled who: a
 * plane is a property of a comparison and the index is a property of a render, so the transform is a
 * step of **the comparison**, which is this function.
 *
 * §4 states the mistake this exists to prevent, in as many words: *"an engine that expects canonical
 * bounds from the index either compares raw render coordinates or transforms an already-transformed
 * box, and both report `element-moved` for an element that never moved."* A false invalidation with
 * a plausible explanation attached is worse than a missing check, because nothing surfaces it.
 *
 * The transform, exactly as §4's table gives it: subtract the candidate box's origin, then scale
 * **x and y independently** — `plane.width / candidateBox.width` for x, `plane.height /
 * candidateBox.height` for y. Independently because `boxCanvas` stretches width and height
 * separately and the comparison explicitly *supports* the two content boxes disagreeing about
 * proportion, which is exactly the case an acceptance is most likely to be sitting on; a
 * single-ratio projection would land the box at the right x and the wrong y.
 *
 * Rounding is outward at both ends (D5 answer 5) — the index's own render-pixel box first, then the
 * transformed one — so displacement is measured between two integer boxes. Outward rounding is
 * idempotent on a box that is already integral, so an already-integer index is not inflated.
 *
 * A box that clips to nothing keeps its `count` and loses its `bounds`: the tag still exists in the
 * tree, and the gate's own rule for a resolved node carrying no usable geometry takes over from
 * there. Dropping the entry entirely would say the tag had *vanished*, which is a different verdict.
