/**
 * rc-size-modifier.test.mjs — the player honours the size a component was *asked* for.
 *
 * Run with `node --test scripts/design-artifacts/`.
 *
 * Two measure-pass defects made a component render at a size nobody requested, and both were
 * invisible to every other check: the document parses, no opcode is unknown, nothing warns. Only
 * the pixels tell you — which is why this exercises the built bundle
 * (`build/vendored-rc-player-js/bundle.js`) in a real browser, the same reason
 * `rc-round-clip.test.mjs` does. A stale bundle beside fixed source is exactly the regression worth
 * catching.
 *
 * 1. **A widget's own default size clobbered the caller's.** A size modifier chain is emitted
 *    outermost-first, and `RemoteIcon(modifier = size(48.dp))` writes the caller's 48 followed by
 *    the widget's built-in 24 dp default. Compose resolves `size(48).size(24)` to 48 — the outer
 *    call fixes the constraints and the inner is coerced into them — but the player kept the *last*
 *    fixed modifier, so every icon in every document rendered at 24 dp regardless of what was
 *    asked for.
 *
 * 2. **A container forwarded its own minimum to its children.** A weighted row cell is measured
 *    with min == max so it fills its slot; passing that minimum down made every child at least as
 *    large as the cell, so a `size(20)` icon and a wrapped label both came out full-cell and
 *    overlapped their neighbours.
 *
 * The fixture is the catalog's own `IconRemote` sticker — `RemoteIcon(starIcon, size(iconSize))` on
 * a 200×200 dp canvas — paired with the AndroidX-baked PNG of the same preview from the same bundle
 * pack. Comparing against that reference rather than a hand-computed box keeps the expectation
 * honest: it asserts the player agrees with the renderer everyone else's output is measured
 * against, instead of re-stating whatever the player currently happens to do. A whole-canvas diff
 * is safe to assert *here* specifically because this sticker draws one tinted glyph and no text, so
 * there are no font metrics to drift. The regression scored 5.8% against this reference; the player
 * now matches it exactly.
