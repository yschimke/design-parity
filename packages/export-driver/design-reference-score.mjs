/**
 * Score a published design reference against the sticker it will be compared with, at publish time.
 *
 * The viewer has always been able to answer "how close is this render to its spec?" — but only
 * after a visitor entered the spec lane and waited for two rasters to decode and normalise. So the
 * one fact a design catalog exists to report was the one fact no page showed at rest, and the chip
 * that led to it said only "Figma". Carrying the number in `references/index.json` puts it on the
 * chip on first paint, for free, on every page that has a reference.
 *
 * ## Why this drives a browser
 *
 * The scorer is not a pixel diff. `format-compare.js` crops both sides to their content box,
 * redraws them into one shared box, converts to luma, and walks an edge-tolerant search with a
 * positional cost — so a Figma export at a different scale or padding than the render is compared
 * on what it *looks like* rather than on where its bytes happen to sit. Restating that in Node
 * would be a second implementation of a subtle algorithm, and the moment the two disagree the chip
 * contradicts the readout it links to — the worst possible failure for a number whose entire job is
 * to be trusted at a glance.
 *
 * So this loads the viewer's own asset into a blank page and calls it. There is exactly one
 * scorer, and the baked number is the number the lane would compute. Chromium is already this
 * script's rasteriser for HTML references, so it is not a new dependency — only a newly
 * unconditional one.
 *
 * ## Failure posture
 *
 * Fail-soft, like every other part of the reference lane: no browser, an undecodable pair, a
 * scorer that throws ⇒ no `match` on that record, and the reference publishes exactly as it did
 * before this file existed. The chip then shows the plain provider label and the lane computes the
 * score live on entry, which is the behaviour every published catalog has today.
