/**
 * Fail a sharded render that lost work, at the point the loss is still attributable.
 *
 * Run after `compose-preview bundle merge`, before the catalog is generated:
 *
 *   node verify-shard-renders.mjs --bundle bundle.png shard-plan-1.json shard-plan-2.json …
 *
 * `shard-preview-ids.mjs --verify` already cross-checks the shards' *plans* — same discovered set,
 * pairwise disjoint, complete cover. This checks the *outcome*, which is a different question and
 * the one that went unasked: m3-catalog run 31217598543 passed the plan check (`6 shard(s) cover
 * 1095 preview(s) exactly once`) and merged 267 of those 1095, because each shard's unanchored
 * exclusion list also deleted the `_VARIANT_` fan-out of every id it excluded (m3-catalog#15). The
 * anchored `=<id>` form (#3561) fixed that cause; nothing yet noticed the effect, and the run was
 * green.
 *
 * The glue is thin on purpose — both halves it composes are pure and unit-tested without an
 * `npm ci` (`capturedPreviewIds` in `bundle-previews.mjs`, `verifyShardRenders` in
 * `shard-preview-ids.mjs`). Only the bundle read needs the export engine, which is why this lives in
 * its own file rather than as another mode on `shard-preview-ids.mjs`: that module is deliberately
 * dependency-free so a shard job can run it without installing anything.
