/**
 * Per-entry / per-axis render priority for a catalog spec (issue #2950).
 *
 * A catalog declares which entries MUST be baked into the published bundle and which may be left to
 * the preview server to produce on demand:
 *
 *   - `priority: "required"` (the default) — rendered, joined, and subject to the strict
 *     completeness gate exactly as before.
 *   - `priority: "deferred"` — recorded in `catalog.json` as live-only and NOT counted as a missing
 *     render or missing-semantics failure. The entry is still discovered (so it stays addressable on
 *     the serve host, which re-renders it from the carried live bundle / buildable source); it is
 *     simply not rasterised in CI.
 *
 * Two forms, because they buy different things:
 *
 *   - **per axis** — `modePriority: { "light": "required", "*": "deferred" }`. Bakes one sticker per
 *     component and leaves the remaining palettes to the (already interactive) theme switcher on the
 *     serve host. Measured against a nine-theme catalog this is the bigger lever, because the fan-out
 *     lives in the BASE entries rather than the variants. Degrades safely: the component keeps its
 *     untagged primary sticker in `components[]`, so the served catalog browses as before with one
 *     fewer baked palette. The mode axis is skipped at render time by the **id** filter (#2966).
 *   - **per entry** — `priority` on a component or one of its `variants`. A wholly-deferred entry names
 *     a `@Preview` function nothing else needs, so it is dropped from the render itself (see
 *     [renderFilterPatterns]) — real build time, not just a smaller bundle. Such an entry has no
 *     `images[]` record at all, so it reaches a viewer only through the serve host's live lane
 *     (`catalog.json` `deferred[]` → `ServeCatalogStore`, compose-ai-tools#2965).
 *
 * Deferral is always explicit and always opt-in: the default stays `required`, so a spec that says
 * nothing behaves exactly as it did. Deferral needs a live path (a carried live bundle or a buildable
 * `source`), or the deferred entries would just be coverage silently dropped from the published
 * sheet — the driver enforces that, and `validateSpec` mirrors it when the caller knows. A server with
 * no live path still degrades explicably rather than showing broken cards: it reports
 * `deferred-not-served` and omits them.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (node built-ins only, no `@design-parity/*`, no I/O) so it unit-tests
 * without an `npm ci`, like its sibling `catalog-variants.mjs` / `catalog-spec.mjs`.

 * an empty list, "render everything" — it has no way to say "render nothing". So an all-deferred
 * catalog collapses to an empty filter that both workflows read as *render all*, rasterising the
 * whole sheet precisely where deferral should have saved the most, while the published bundle
 * carries no baked stickers at all. Rather than plumb a render-none sentinel through the pre-flight
 * and both workflows for a config that publishes an empty sticker sheet, the validator rejects it:
 * a catalog must keep at least one `required` preview, matching the positive-list philosophy on
 * [renderFilterPatterns] — name what must render, so a spec that would render nothing (or everything
 * by accident) fails loudly.
 *
 * Keyed off the same [previewNamesByPriority] split the render filter derives from, so it flags
 * exactly the specs that would otherwise empty the filter through deferral. Mode-level deferral
 * can't trigger it — it never empties the preview list — and a catalog that defers nothing is the
 * ordinary render-all case, also not flagged.
 *
 * Reflects only the spec's OWN `groups`, which is all the pre-flight render filter sees too. A hybrid
 * catalog can leave its required entries in `@CatalogComponent` annotations and place only deferred
 * overrides in `spec.groups`; those annotation entries are merged in as `required` by the driver
 * (`mergeCatalogGroups`), so such a spec is not truly all-deferred. The caller must therefore only act
 * on a `true` here when the spec's groups are known to be the complete inventory — `validateSpec`
 * gates on `annotatedInventory === false` for exactly that reason.

 * historical behaviour, and what every catalog without `priority` gets).
 *
 * The other way to reach an empty list — a spec that defers EVERY preview, leaving nothing required
 * — would be read as render-all too, inverting the saving (issue #2993). That case never reaches a
 * real render: `validateSpec` rejects it up front (see [defersEveryPreview]), so the only empty this

 * Deliberately a POSITIVE list rather than an exclusion: the renderer's filter fails fast when it
 * matches nothing, so naming what must render turns a stale spec into a loud failure instead of a
 * silently empty render. Plain names are substring-matched by `PreviewNameFilter`, so a required
