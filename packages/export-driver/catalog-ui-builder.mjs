/**
 * Publish the render bundle's generated **builder catalog** (`ui-builder.json`) beside
 * `catalog.json` and `components.json`.
 *
 * The Gradle plugin's discovery task generates `ui-builder.json` from three inputs the catalog
 * repository owns — the discovered component record, the `catalog.spec.json` cover sheet, and the
 * authored `ui-builder.policy.json` — and packs it into every bundle. It is the file a UI builder
 * reads to know what platform this catalog is, how its screens are framed and written, which shelf
 * each component sits on and how the canvas may draw it: knowledge that used to be written in
 * Kotlin inside the preview server, per catalog, by hand
 * (https://github.com/yschimke/compose-preview-server/blob/main/docs/design/UI_BUILDER_CATALOG_CONTRACT.md).
 *
 * So it is copied out to the branch root and declared on the manifest as `uiBuilderFile`, exactly
 * as `catalog-component-record.mjs` does for `components.json` and for the same reason: a consumer
 * fetches the one file it wants rather than a 15-50 MB polyglot, and a catalog that publishes no
 * live bundle still carries it somewhere a reader can reach.
 *
 * **Most catalogs publish nothing here, and that is the design.** A catalog that authors no
 * `ui-builder.policy.json` produces no `ui-builder.json`, this writes nothing and the manifest says
 * nothing — which is what makes the contract cost zero for every catalog that has not adopted it.
 *
 * Primary bundle only, matching the record: a multi-module catalog's additional bundles each carry
 * their own, and the primary's is the one the catalog's previews were discovered from.
