/**
 * Build the bundle view handed to `@design-parity/candidate`'s `bundleToCandidates`, keeping only
 * previews that carry a static `previews/<id>.png` raster. Returns `{ bundle, dropped }` where
 * `bundle` is a shallow clone with a filtered `previews` array (the original is left untouched) and
 * `dropped` is the ids removed.
 *
 * `bundleToCandidates` represents every preview as a PNG sticker and throws `InvalidBundleError` on a
 * missing `previews/<id>.png`, so a preview whose only artifact is non-raster would fail the whole
 * catalog export. Two kinds of preview have no PNG:
 *   - animated captures — a `@ScrollingPreview` `ScrollMode.GIF` preview emits only
 *     `previews/<id>.gif` (e.g. the wear catalog's `CardScalingScrollGif`); it isn't an importable
 *     static sticker, so it's simply excluded from the candidate join.
 *   - catalog-token sheets — `@ColorCatalog` / `@TypographyCatalog` / `@ThemeCatalog` metadata
 *     previews are rendered PNG-less by design, but their `previews/<id>.catalog.json` sidecars are
 *     read separately via `catalogTokensFromBundle(bundle)` to export `themeTokens`.
 *   - previews that simply produce no still — an `AndroidView`-hosted composable, a horologist
 *     `ScalingLazyColumn` screen. Nothing in the annotations marks these, so a spec that catalogues
 *     one declares it with `"capture": "none"` (see capture-mode.mjs / issue #2946); they are
 *     dropped here like the rest, but don't count as a missing render.
 *
 * Because this returns a **clone** and never mutates `bundle.previews`, those catalog-token sheets
 * stay in the original bundle for the token pass (and layout wireframes / fonts manifest, which
 * iterate the full list) — only the candidate join sees the filtered view.

/**
 * `functionName -> [daemon preview id, …]` across every bundle, in bundle order. Falsy entries are
 * skipped so callers can pass `[bundle, extraBundle]` with no supplementary render; the first
 * bundle to claim an id wins, matching the primary-is-authoritative fold everywhere else.
 *
 * The live lane for a DEFERRED catalog entry (issue #2950) keys off this: its preview was never
 * rasterised, so it has no `image.previewId` to bridge from — but it is still listed in the
 * bundle's `previews.json`, because the bundle task carries every selected preview and simply omits
 * the PNG for one that didn't render. That listing is what makes a deferred entry addressable on
 * the serve host instead of lost.

/**
 * The ids of previews the bundle actually **captured** — those carrying at least one
 * `previews/<id>.*` artifact of any kind.
 *
 * Deliberately "any artifact", not "a PNG": [candidatePreviewBundle] already answers the PNG
 * question, and the two are asking different things. Plenty of previews are PNG-less *by design*
 * — an animated `ScrollMode.GIF` capture emits only a `.gif`, a `@ColorCatalog` / `@ThemeCatalog`
 * sheet only a `.catalog.json`, a `"capture": "none"` entry nothing raster at all — so a PNG check
 * would call all of those a loss. What no captured preview ever lacks is *every* artifact: a pack
 * runs `--with-semantics`, so even a raster-less preview comes back with its `.semantics.json`.
 *
 * A preview an `--exclude-preview-id` pattern matched, by contrast, is skipped in **both** passes
 * (that is the whole point of the CLI applying the same exclusion list to the render and the
 * semantics capture), so it comes back with nothing at all under `previews/`. That asymmetry is
 * what makes "no artifact whatsoever" a precise signal for *excluded* rather than *PNG-less*, and
 * it is what `verify-shard-renders.mjs` compares the shard plans against after a sharded merge.
 *
 * A render **failure** counts as captured, deliberately: a preview that blew up leaves
 * `previews/<id>.error.json` and no PNG, and it is not what this signal is looking for. An excluded
 * preview never reaches the renderer, so it can never carry an error sidecar — meaning the sidecar
 * cannot mask an exclusion loss, only cause a misleading one. Render failures have their own
 * reporting (`render-failures.mjs`, and the completeness gate); crediting them here keeps the shard
 * check from failing a run with the wrong diagnosis.
 *
 * The one hole in that reasoning is that semantics capture is **best-effort** — a missing daemon
 * descriptor, a failed session open, or an empty capture leaves `packSemanticsBlob` returning null
 * and the pack succeeding anyway — so a bundle can carry no `.semantics.json` at all. A raster-less
 * preview then really does have zero artifacts for a reason that has nothing to do with sharding.
 * [bundleCapturedSemantics] is how the caller detects that and declines to judge; see
 * `verifyShardRenders`.
 *
 * Ids are returned in the caller's namespace: bundle entries are stored under filename-safe ids
 * while shard plans and `design-map.json` are authored against the canonical discovery id, so
 * [rawIdFor] maps one to the other (`rawPreviewIdForEntry` from `@design-parity/candidate`). It
 * defaults to the entry id, which is correct whenever no sanitising happened.
 *
