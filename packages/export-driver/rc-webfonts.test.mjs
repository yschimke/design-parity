/**
 * rc-webfonts.test.mjs — the player's *named* font family support.
 *
 * Run with `node --test scripts/design-artifacts/`.
 *
 * These exercise the built bundle (`build/vendored-rc-player-js/bundle.js`) in a real browser
 * rather than the TypeScript source, because the bundle is the artifact that actually ships and the
 * behaviour under test is browser machinery — `@font-face` laziness, CSS font matching, the
 * `FontFace` registry — that has no meaningful pure-JS stand-in.
 *
 * Hermetic on purpose: the registration test serves its own stylesheet and a *vendored* TTF from
 * localhost via the player's `baseUrl` knob, so it never touches fonts.googleapis.com. The request
 * form aimed at the real API is pinned separately, as a pure string assertion — that is the part
 * that has to stay exactly right (see the comment on the weight matrix below) and the part a network
 * test would make flaky rather than more convincing.
