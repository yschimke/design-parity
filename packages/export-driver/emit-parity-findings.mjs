/**
 * Write a published catalog's `parity/findings.json` — the verdict behind the preview server's
 * **Design parity** panel on every focused comparison.
 *
 *     node emit-parity-findings.mjs --out <bundle dir> --repo <repo root> \
 *       [--design-map design-map.json] [--spec catalog.spec.json] \
 *       [--parity-branch design-parity/<system>] [--source-repo owner/name] [--strict]
 *
 * `--out` is the staged bundle the workflow is about to publish to `design-artifacts/<system>`;
 * this adds one file and leaves the rest alone. Safe to run unconditionally: a repo whose parity
 * run has never published a branch simply writes nothing, and its comparisons serve exactly as they
 * did before the panel existed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a publish step
 *
 * The findings are produced by a design-parity run, which publishes them to its OWN branch
 * (`design-parity/<system>`, beside the per-component reports) keyed by the ids a run knows: the
 * fully-qualified compose preview id and the design-map code handle. The compare page routes on
 * neither — it routes on the catalog's sticker id, which is minted here, at publish. So the join
 * happens here, in the one job that holds both the run's output and the catalog it will be shown
 * against. See `parity-findings.mjs` for the re-keying rules.
 *
 * The same shape as `emit-parity-activity.mjs` next door, and for the same reason: the serve host
 * has no checkout and cannot read another branch.
 *
 * It also runs after `emit-design-references.mjs`, and now depends on that ordering for a second
 * reason: a finding's reference-side anchor is measured in the space the design tool captured, and
 * the reference step publishes the raster onto the sticker's canvas. The transform it recorded in
 * `references/index.json` is read here and applied to those anchors (#4696).
 *
 * ## Failure posture
 *
 * Fail-soft, matching its neighbours and the server's own reader. No parity branch, an unreadable
 * `findings.json`, a component with no published reference — each is a `::warning::` and the rest
 * publishes, because a verdict panel is an enhancement and must never cost a catalog its render.
 * `--strict` turns any skipped record into a non-zero exit for a repo that wants the panel gated.
