/**
 * Check a catalog spec against a **preview-id manifest**, without rendering (issue #5066).
 *
 * Nearly every failed import cycle is a config-shape error — a spec `preview` that names nothing,
 * an `excludePreviewIds` pattern written in the wrong id shape, an exclusion that removes too few
 * arms of a fan-out — and each one currently costs a full render (20–40 minutes on a real project)
 * to discover. Every one of them is decidable in seconds from a list of preview ids, which is what
 * this module does. Four reports, all from `(spec, previews[, exclusions])`:
 *
 *   - **`missing-preview`** — a spec `preview` (component or variant) that no manifest id's function
 *     answers to. The offline half of the completeness gate's `missing`, and the same check
 *     `validate-catalog-spec.mjs` runs against Kotlin *source* — except this one sees what discovery
 *     actually minted, so it also catches a preview that exists but was never discovered.
 *   - **`unmatched-exclusion`** — an exclusion pattern with a match count of 0 (issue #5064). The
 *     underscores-vs-spaces mistake: `@Preview(name = "Font scale 1.5x")` mints an id carrying
 *     spaces, and a pattern spelled with underscores silently excludes nothing.
 *   - **`excluded-claimed`** — every id of a function the spec claims is excluded, so that component
 *     can only publish as a missing sticker.
 *   - **`duplicate-output-axes`** — ids that survive exclusion and would collide on output axes
 *     (issue #5065): the three-arm locale fan-out whose catalog declares no locale axis, where an
 *     exclusion covering only `_ja` leaves two arms fighting over one sticker path. `foldVariants`
 *     throws on this at the very end of a render; here it is a report, and it names every colliding
 *     pair rather than the first.
 *
 * Plus, as information, the manifest ids no spec component claims — the inverse view, for a catalog
 * that is meant to cover a module.
 *
 * ## What a manifest is, and what the axis model can see
 *
 * Any `{ previews: [{ id, functionName, params, captures }] }` payload: a module's
 * `build/compose-previews/previews.json`, `compose-preview list --json`, or a bundle's manifest.
 * The manifest for a given import changes rarely while the spec and its exclusions change
 * constantly, so a cached snapshot of the slow-moving half is enough to iterate the fast-moving one
 * with no build at all.
 *
 * The output-axis check necessarily models what the render + candidate join WOULD produce, because
 * the real axes are read off rendered images. The model derives, per manifest capture:
 *
 *   - `state` from an `_VARIANT_<name>` id suffix (`variantStateFromId`, the same reader the join
 *     uses);
 *   - `theme` from the declared mode a trailing id segment names (`modeOfPreviewId`), else a
 *     `light`/`dark` id suffix, else `@Preview(uiMode = …)`'s night bits;
 *   - `size` from the spec's `breakpoints` (`breakpointMatcher`, shared with the join);
 *   - `props.fontScale` from a non-default `fontScale` param, mirroring `applyCatalogPreviewAxes`.
 *
 * An axis the join derives from pixels or from a source annotation this manifest does not carry is
 * invisible here, so the collision report is a **report**, not the authority: the render's own
 * `foldVariants` guard stays the gate. The bias is deliberately towards silence — two ids that
 * differ only in something the model cannot see are the one shape it can get wrong, and it is worth
 * saying that out loud rather than failing a spec that renders fine.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free apart from its siblings (node built-ins only, no `@design-parity/*`, no
 * I/O) so it unit-tests without an `npm ci`. The `--spec`/`--previews` CLI wrapper at the bottom
 * only runs when this file is executed directly.
