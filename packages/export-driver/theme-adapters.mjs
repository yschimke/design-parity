/**
 * Turn an import's declared themes into the `@ThemeCatalog` providers a third-party module can
 * never declare for itself.
 *
 * A catalog's theme switcher is fed by `declaredThemes` — synthesized from `@ThemeCatalog` /
 * `@WearThemeCatalog` on a `PreviewWrapperProvider` class, an `ee.schimke.composeai.preview`
 * annotation. A project imported without its maintainers' involvement has no such class, so every
 * imported catalog serves an empty Theme control no matter how many palettes the upstream actually
 * has: Pocket Casts ships nine, Twine twelve, Thunderbird's Bolt two brands crossed with light and
 * dark, and preview.coo.ee can show none of them.
 *
 * The import pipeline already edits its throwaway checkout — it appends to the module's build file,
 * adds runtime-only projects and stubs `google-services.json`. Generating the providers is the same
 * move one level up: the spec says which themes exist, this writes the Kotlin, and everything
 * downstream (discovery → THEME_CATALOG previews → `declaredThemes` → the header's theme chips →
 * `?theme=theme:<fqn>` → per-theme `themes/<fqn>.dtcg.json` token sets) works unchanged. Nothing
 * else in the pipeline learns what an import is.
 *
 * ## Why kinds rather than a line of Kotlin each
 *
 * Every theme could be a hand-written wrapper body, and the first draft of this was exactly that.
 * But across fifteen imports the upstreams reach for the same four shapes, and a shape carries
 * information a snippet throws away: which themes are the same family, which are light and which
 * are dark, and what a reviewer is agreeing to when they approve the import's pull request. A
 * `kind` is checkable — a typo'd enum constant is a spec error here rather than a Kotlin
 * compile failure twenty minutes into a render — and it means the twelfth Twine palette costs a
 * string in an array, not a paragraph of code.
 *
 * - **`enum`** — a theme composable taking one enum constant: `AppThemeWithBackground(LIGHT) {}`.
 *   Pocket Casts (`Theme.ThemeType`, nine) and Twine (`ThemeVariant`, twelve).
 * - **`functions`** — one composable per theme: `ThunderbirdBoltTheme {}` / `K9MailBoltTheme {}`.
 *   Thunderbird's Bolt.
 * - **`modes`** — one composable with a boolean dark parameter: `ElementTheme(darkTheme = true) {}`.
 *   Element X, Bitwarden, and most single-brand Material 3 systems.
 * - **`arguments`** — one composable, a named argument list per theme. The general form the three
 *   above are shorthands for; use it when a theme is a call the others cannot spell.
 * - **`wrapper`** — a raw Kotlin body, the documented escape hatch. Twine's
 *   `overriddenColorScheme = solarizedColorScheme(isDark)` is why it exists.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (no `@design-parity/*`, no I/O) so it unit-tests without an `npm ci`,
 * like its siblings `catalog-select.mjs` / `catalog-variants.mjs`. The file-writing half lives in
 * `generate-theme-catalogs.mjs`.
