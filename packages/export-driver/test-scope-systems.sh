# Self-test for scripts/design-artifacts/scope-systems.sh — the path→system
# mapping that decides which design-artifacts delivery branches a merge
# regenerates. CI runs this on every PR (ci.yml).
#
# Both directions matter and both are covered below:
#   • a false NEGATIVE silently strands a delivery branch on stale renders — the
#     exact failure the push trigger exists to prevent;
#   • a false POSITIVE burns a ~90-minute render per system on every unrelated
#     merge.
