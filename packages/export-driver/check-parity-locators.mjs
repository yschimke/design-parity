/**
 * Does every parity locator still name a cell the catalog draws?
 *
 * `parity-issues.mjs` validates a locator's SHAPE — required fields, non-empty values, no component
 * or preview claimed twice in one body. Nothing has ever validated what the `preview` field points
 * AT, because the producer runs against an issue list and has no catalog to resolve it with. So a
 * renamed cell turns an issue's locator into a dangling pointer and every check stays green:
 * `buildIssueIndex` emits the row, the delivery branch carries it, and the compare page simply
 * never shows it, because no preview on any page has that id any more.
 *
 * That is the same place an issue with NO locator lands — skipped, silently, correctly — which is
 * what makes it invisible. It has happened twice on one repository from one rename
 * ([wear-m3-catalog#305](https://github.com/yschimke/wear-m3-catalog/issues/305)), and the second
 * one was found only because somebody distrusted a clean result from the first audit.
 *
 * ## What it resolves against, and why not the preview id
 *
 * A locator's `preview` is a SERVED id (`appcard__ideal__outlined__compact`) minted by the render
 * pipeline out of `catalog.json` — see `revision-preview-index.mjs`. A pull request has no
 * `catalog.json`: it has the discovered `previews.json`, whose ids are fully-qualified Kotlin
 * (`…CatalogPreviewsKt.AppCardRemote_width=227dp,…_VARIANT_outlined`). Reconstructing one from the
 * other would mean re-implementing the pipeline's naming in a checker, which is exactly the kind of
 * fork that lets a validator and its producer drift apart.
 *
 * So this resolves the pair the two forms genuinely share: the **component id** and the **cell**.
 * `component:` is a locator field, and the cell is the served id's third segment — the same segment
 * the sheet spells `_VARIANT_<cell>` on the manifest side. A rename moves the cell on both sides at
 * once, which is the whole failure this catches, and neither side has to know how the other builds
 * a string.
 *
 * ## Why a baseline, rather than "every locator must resolve"
 *
 * A blanket assertion fails pull requests that had nothing to do with the breakage: one issue
 * edited to a bad id and every subsequent PR is red, with the fix nowhere in its diff. Given
 * `--published` — the delivery branch's `preview-index.json`, which is what the catalog last
 * actually served — an unresolvable id splits in two:
 *
 * - it **was** served and is not drawn now: this change broke it. A failure, and the PR that
 *   renamed the cell is the one holding it.
 * - it was never served: a typo, or breakage that predates the baseline. Reported as a warning,
 *   because failing here would punish the wrong commit.
 *
 * Without `--published` every unresolvable id is a failure, which is what a scheduled or
 * publish-side run wants: there, nothing is "somebody else's PR".
