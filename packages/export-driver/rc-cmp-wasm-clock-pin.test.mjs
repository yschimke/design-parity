/**
 * rc-cmp-wasm-clock-pin.test.mjs — a clock-reading document must render the same pixels twice.
 *
 * Run with `node --test scripts/design-artifacts/`. Skipped unless the player distribution is built
 * (`./gradlew :rc-player-wasm:wasmPlayerDist`, or point `RC_CMP_WASM_DIST` at one) — set
 * `RC_CMP_WASM_REQUIRE=1` to turn every skip into a failure, which is how the `CMP/Wasm Frame
 * Pacing` CI job runs the browser-level guards.
 *
 * The regression this guards (#4431): `remote-m3`'s indeterminate circular progress builds its
 * sweep from a float expression over `CONTINUOUS_SEC`, which the player loads from the wall clock.
 * The capture is not caught mid-animation — measured, the pose is picked at load and then holds
 * still for at least 7 s, which is why the settle loop converges and reports nothing wrong — but
 * *which* pose depends on the second the render started at. So the parity lane scored the second
 * hand: 0.05%–0.94% for this one row across five pull requests that never touched a render path,
 * against a 0.25 pp gate.
 *
 * This is the check #4431 (and #3558 before it) asked for and never got: render one commit twice in
 * this lane and diff the two captures against each other. Unpinned they differ; pinned
 * (`rc-clock.mjs`) they are byte-identical.
