/**
 * Stamp each spec component's `parallel` (its counterpart in the `compareWith` sibling) onto the
 * built catalog manifest.
 *
 * `parallel` has been build-time-only in practice. It is on the *bundle* wire model
 * (`PreviewData.kt`'s `CatalogEntry.parallel`) and the generator reads it off the spec to build
 * `matches.html` — but the PUBLISHED `catalog.json` never carried it, because `toCatalogManifest`
 * allow-lists the component fields it knows and drops the rest with no error anywhere. The same
 * silent drop that hid `motion` for a day (see {@link file://./motion-carried.mjs}) and that
 * `compareWith` needs its own post-write stamp to escape.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: `remote-m3`'s published catalog — a sheet whose entire purpose is the
 * cross-system pairing — listed 51 components and zero `parallel` fields.
 *
 * That is what keeps a consumer of the published catalog from resolving the pairing at all. The
 * manifest's `compareWith` says WHICH SYSTEM the counterpart lives in; `parallel` says WHICH
 * COMPONENT. Half a pairing resolves to nothing, so both have to travel for a preview server to
 * offer the sibling as a comparison source (issue #4621).
 *
 * Additive and idempotent, exactly like {@link file://./apply-spec-sections.mjs}:
 *  - only components whose spec entry declares a `parallel` are touched;
 *  - a component that already carries one (a future `toCatalogManifest` that learns the field) is
 *    left as-is, so bumping the pin makes this a no-op rather than a conflict.
 *
 * This carries the declaration verbatim and does NOT check that the sibling has such a component.
 * That resolution already happens where it can be done properly — against the sibling's own
 * inventory, when the compare page is built — and a `parallel` naming nothing there is reported
 * as an unpaired row there. Silently dropping it here would hide a spec typo behind an absent
 * field instead.
 *
 * @param {{components?: Array<{componentId: string, parallel?: string}>}} manifest
 *   The parsed `catalog.json`, mutated in place.
 * @param {{groups?: Array<{components?: Array<{componentId: string, parallel?: string}>}>}} spec
 *   The catalog spec the manifest was built from.
 * @returns {number} how many components had a `parallel` newly stamped.
 */
/**
 * `componentId -> parallel`, for every spec component that declares one.
 *
 * Exported because the manifest is stamped in two places and they must read the spec the same way.
 * `applyParallels` runs over `manifest.components` while the manifest is being assembled; the
 * DEFERRED records are attached later (`generate-design-catalog.mjs` builds them after this call),
 * so they cannot be reached from here and are stamped at their own construction from this same map.
 * Two hand-rolled readers would eventually disagree about the blank rule below, which is the only
 * subtle part.
 *
 * @param {{groups?: Array<{components?: Array<{componentId: string, parallel?: string}>}>}} spec
 * @returns {Map<string, string>}
