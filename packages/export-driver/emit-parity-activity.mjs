/**
 * Write a published catalog's `parity/activity.json` — the feed behind the preview server's
 * **Design parity** view (`/<system>/parity`).
 *
 *     node emit-parity-activity.mjs --out <bundle dir> --repo <repo root> \
 *       [--design-map design-map.json] [--days 30] [--source-repo owner/name] [--ref main] \
 *       [--figma-file <key>] [--strict]
 *
 * `--out` is the staged bundle the workflow is about to publish to `design-artifacts/<system>`;
 * this adds one file and leaves the rest alone. Safe to run unconditionally: a repo with no git
 * history, no design map, and no Figma token simply writes nothing.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a publish step rather than a server feature
 *
 * The serve host holds **no Figma credential** and has no checkout — see the header of
 * `parity-activity.mjs` and `docs/public-preview-server.md`. This job has both: it is already
 * running in the repo, and it already holds `FIGMA_TOKEN` to rasterize design references. So it
 * snapshots the activity here and the server only renders it.
 *
 * ## What it reads
 *
 * - **code**: `git log` over the window, `--name-only`, joined to previews through
 *   `design-map.json`'s `code` handles.
 * - **design**: `GET /v1/files/:key/versions` and `GET /v1/files/:key/comments` — two read-only
 *   endpoints, both already covered by the token the reference rasteriser uses. The file key comes
 *   from the design map's own `figma:` refs, so nothing new has to be configured.
 * - **gaps**: computed by `mappingGaps` against the published `catalog.json` and, when the token is
 *   present, `GET /v1/files/:key/components`.
 *
 * ## Failure posture
 *
 * Fail-soft, matching `emit-design-references.mjs` and the server's own reader: a lane that can't
 * be read is skipped with a `::warning::` and the rest publishes. No token ⇒ the code lane and the
 * gaps still publish, which is the normal state for a fork or a PR run. `--strict` turns any
 * skipped lane into a non-zero exit for a repo that wants its parity feed gated.
