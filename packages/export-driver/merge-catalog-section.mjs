/**
 * Merge a **borrowed** built catalog into a **primary** built catalog as one new
 * top-level section (tab).
 *
 * The end use: meshcore-mobile reuses the published compose-m3 stickersheet —
 * re-themed under meshcore's palette (`bundle render --knob --res --svg` +
 * `bundle repack`, then `generate-design-catalog.mjs` over that re-themed
 * bundle) — surfaced as its own "Material 3" tab inside meshcore's catalog. Both
 * catalogs are built independently by {@link file://./generate-design-catalog.mjs}
 * (each from its own `catalog.spec.json` + render bundle); this step splices the
 * borrowed one in without either side having to know about the other's spec.
 *
 * What it does, given `--into <primaryOut> --from <borrowedOut> --section <name>`:
 *  - retags every borrowed component with `section: <name>` (the tab it lands
 *    under; its own `group` stays the sub-heading), optionally prefixing the
 *    group via `--group-prefix`,
 *  - strips each borrowed image's `livePreview` deep link (it targets the
 *    borrowed system's own server path, which would mis-link inside the host
 *    catalog — the borrowed section is baked-PNG here),
 *  - folds the borrowed catalog's per-component assets — the files under its
 *    subdirectories (`images/`, `wireframes/`, `figma/`) — into the primary out
 *    dir at the same relative paths, refusing to clobber a differing primary
 *    file,
 *  - appends the borrowed components to the primary `catalog.json` and rewrites
 *    it in place.
 *
 * A catalog's **top-level** files stay the host's: the manifest (`catalog.json`,
 * merged separately above), the token/Figma projections, the `code-connect.json`
 * mappings, the `components.json` component record (the host module's own
 * discovery output), and the generated `index.html` / `compare.html` / `README.md` pages
 * — each is derived from that catalog's own component set, and both catalogs
 * (produced by the same generator) carry them, so copying the borrowed ones would
 * collide. The host's generated pages therefore don't reflect the folded section;
 * the preview server renders tabs from the merged `catalog.json`, and a caller
 * that needs the static pages refreshed re-runs the generator's page renderers
 * over the merged catalog. The borrowed token files aren't merged either (the
 * re-themed pixels already carry the host palette — a token-set union is a
 * possible fast-follow). componentIds must not collide across the two catalogs.

 * hypothetical: it took every folding catalog in compose-samples down once the M3
 * section started emitting a non-empty one, which is the same way the annotations
 * case first surfaced.
 *
 * Union by preview id, host wins. A folded component becomes a tab in the host, so
