 * Apply a catalog spec's named breakpoints to candidate images.
 *
 * The candidate reader classifies numeric `widthDp` values with Material window
 * size classes (`compact` / `medium` / `expanded`). Catalog specs may declare a
 * more useful vocabulary for their domain, such as Wear's `smallRound` and
 * `largeRound`. Re-tag matching images after the bundle has been read so those
 * declared names become the catalog's size axis.
 *
 * A breakpoint may be declared by `device` (the `@Preview(device = …)` id the render actually ran
 * under, e.g. `id:wearos_small_round`) as well as by `widthDp`. Prefer the device: it is the
 * annotation's own identity, carried verbatim through discovery from the multipreview expansion
 * table, whereas a width is a fingerprint that two devices can share and that a device the spec
 * never listed silently fails to match — leaving the image on the generic `compact` class and
 * collapsing two distinct renders onto one output axis. `widthDp` stays supported (and is still
 * worth declaring: the live-preview bridge scores a candidate annotation's width against it), but
 * it is now the fallback rather than the only key.
 *
