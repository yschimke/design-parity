// State-only variants carry no props, so the key stays `${id}\0${state}`, unchanged.
//
// `theme` is a separate trailing segment rather than folded into `props` because it is

//   - a MULTIPREVIEW-THEMED component (one `@Preview` rendered `_Light`/`_Dark`) has no
//     theme in its spec at all, so its images must still resolve on the theme-less key.
//
// Hence the resolver below tries the theme-qualified key first and falls back to the bare
// one — a lookup order that leaves every pre-existing catalog on exactly the path it took
// before theme existed.
//
// `size` is a third optional trailing segment, for exactly the same reason as `theme`: a spec may
// split a component's breakpoints across separate `@Preview` functions, and those must not collide
// with a component whose sizes come from one function's several annotations. The resolver below
