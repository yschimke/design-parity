/**
 * The `motion` axis of a published catalog component — the animated captures a component publishes
 * alongside its static sticker.
 *
 * ### Why this is its own axis rather than more `images[]`
 *
 * Everything in `images[]` is a still, and every consumer of that array assumes it: the sticker
 * sheet lays them out as a grid, the design-parity run diffs them against a Figma node, the Figma
 * import writes them into a frame. An animated capture is none of those things — there is no
 * meaningful "diff this APNG against a kit node", and a sheet that pasted a 114-frame recording in
 * as a sticker would publish its first frame and silently drop the point.
 *
 * So a motion capture rides beside the stills instead. The component keeps exactly the card it had;
 * `motion[]` is additive, and a consumer that has never heard of it is unaffected.
 *
 * ### What lands here
 *
 * Both halves of motion capture, which are the same artifact to a reader and differ only in what
 * moved the pixels:
 *   - `@InteractionPreview` — a scripted pointer gesture (`kind: "interaction"`)
 *   - `@AnimatedPreview` — a self-running animation (`kind: "animation"`)
 *
 * Each entry carries the caption its annotation declared, because a motion capture without one is
 * close to useless: the reader can see *that* something moved, and the caption is what tells them
 * which property they are being shown.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it unit-tests without an `npm ci`, like its sibling axis modules.

/**
 * Folds a component's motion artifacts onto it, keyed by the theme its render was baked under so the
 * viewer can show the capture matching the card the reader is looking at.
 *
 * The theme is read off the sibling **still** rather than off the motion artifact, deliberately: a
 * capture's own id carries the same `_Dark` / `_Light` suffix, but re-deriving it here would be a
 * second implementation of the mode-naming rule that `catalog-themes.mjs` already owns, and the two
 * would eventually disagree about a catalog with unusual mode names. Taking the theme the sibling
 * still already resolved keeps one rule.
 *
 * **That sibling is found by preview id, not by filename.** A capture and its still share a preview
 * id, and [themeByPreviewId] carries the theme each id's candidate resolved. The filename-stem match
 * below looks like it would do the same job and does not: a candidate image is
 * `{state, width, height, theme, uri}` with a `data:` URI — it has no `path` at all — so that
 * comparison silently answered `undefined` for every real catalog. A capture with no theme is pinned
 * to *every* card of its component, so the first catalog to publish captures showed the dark
 * recording on the light card and the light one on the dark card, offered as an unlabelled
 * "Motion (2)" picker. The stem match is kept only as a fallback for a caller whose images do carry
 * `path`.
 *
 * When `motionPreview` names a separate function, its ids differ from the still's. In that case
 * [motionPreviewCells] describe the two functions' fan-outs with their preview parameters; the join
 * maps equal axis cells even when declaration order differs, declines ambiguous cells, and the
 * mapped still's id is then looked up in the same [themeByPreviewId].
 *
 * @param {Array<{path?: string, theme?: string}>} images the component's baked stills.
 * @param {Array<{path: string, previewId?: string, kind: string, caption?: string}>} artifacts from [motionArtifactsFor].
 * @param {Array<{id: string, params?: object}>} previewCells static preview fan-out cells.
 * @param {Array<{id: string, params?: object}>} motionPreviewCells motion preview fan-out cells.
 * @param {Map<string, string>} [themeByPreviewId] preview id → the theme its candidate resolved.
 * @returns {Array<object>} one motion entry per artifact, theme-tagged where it could be resolved.
