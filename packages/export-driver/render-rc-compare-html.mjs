/**
 * Render a self-contained `rc-compare.html` for a design-artifact catalog that
 * ships Remote Compose documents (`ir/<id>.rc`): every preview on one row, with
 * **one column per player** — the baked **PNG** (the Robolectric/Skiko render,
 * source of truth) alongside the same document as each Remote Compose player
 * renders it.
 *
 * The page **does not diff by default**. It opens as a plain side-by-side wall of
 * every player's render, which is what you want when the question is "what does
 * each player draw?". Diffing is opt-in: pick **one** column as the reference in
 * the toolbar and every other column grows a pixel diff beneath its render plus a
 * mismatch chip in the row's meta cell. Picking the baked lane reuses the diffs the
 * driver already computed at build time (exact `pixelmatch` numbers, no work in
 * the browser); picking any *player* as the reference — e.g. "how far is CMP Wasm
 * from CMP JVM?", a question the build-time lane-vs-baked diffs cannot answer —
 * diffs client-side on a `<canvas>` with pixelmatch's YIQ metric at the same
 * threshold.
 *
 * This is the RC counterpart of `render-compare-html.mjs` (PNG↔figma-svg). This
 * module stays a pure string emitter over the driver's result model — it never
 * touches a browser or the filesystem — so it remains unit-testable with a
 * hand-built model; the interactive part is the plain-JS snippet it inlines,
 * driven by the row model it also inlines as JSON.
 *
 * Player lanes, each its own column and its own build-time mismatch % against the
 * baked render (the summary header keeps reporting those, since they are the
 * recorded parity numbers):
 *
 * * **JS player** — the vendored TypeScript `RC.RcdPlayer` on a `<canvas>`, the
 *   browser render lane.
 * * **AndroidX Embedded · vendored Android** — the vendored AndroidX `RcPlayer`
 *   (`:third-party-rc-embedded-player`), a pure-Compose interpreter of the same
 *   document. This is the lane that differs from `remote-player-view`'s
 *   `RemoteComposePlayer` (an Android `View` painting to a framework `Canvas`),
 *   so it shows what a host embedding RC content *inside* a Compose tree gets.
 * * **cmp-jvm / cmp-wasm** — optional Compose Multiplatform / Skiko player lanes
 *   on desktop and in browser Wasm.
 *
 * A row is kept even when only one player could render it — the per-player
 * `rendered` flags are independent, and a player that could not decode the
 * document shows its note in place of the image.
 *
 * Model shape (produced by rc-compare.mjs):
 *   {
 *     system, title,
 *     rows: [{
 *       id, name, group,
 *       width, height,
 *       rendered,            // false when the JS player could not decode the doc
 *       note,                // optional reason when !rendered
 *       mismatchPct,         // 0..100, null when !rendered
 *       mismatchPx,          // integer, null when !rendered
 *       baked, rc, diff,     // out-relative image paths ('' when absent)
 *       referenceBlank,      // true when the baked render is fully transparent — see below
 *
 *       embeddedRendered,    // false when the embedded player could not render it
 *       embeddedNote,        // optional reason when !embeddedRendered
 *       embeddedMismatchPct, // 0..100, null when !embeddedRendered
 *       embeddedMismatchPx,  // integer, null when !embeddedRendered
 *       embedded,            // out-relative path to the embedded render ('' when absent)
 *       embeddedDiff,        // out-relative path to its diff ('' when absent)
 *       androidxEmbeddedRendered, androidxEmbeddedNote,
 *       androidxEmbeddedMismatchPct, androidxEmbeddedMismatchPx,
 *       androidxEmbedded, androidxEmbeddedDiff, // same fields for the androidx.dev player
 *     }],
 *   }
 *
 * The embedded/cmp-jvm/cmp-wasm fields are optional: a model without them (an
 * older summary, or a run where the lane was skipped) omits that column entirely
 * rather than showing it empty, and the lane never appears in the reference picker.
 *
 * `referenceBlank` marks a preview whose baked render carries no opaque pixel at all
 * (a capture that produced nothing). Both sides flatten onto the same neutral
 * background before diffing, so a player that also draws nothing scores an exact
 * 0.00% — a green "good" band for a comparison that never happened. Such rows are
 * shown (the blank baked capture is itself the finding) but excluded from every
 * mean, sorted with the unrenderable rows, and score `no reference` whenever the
 * the baked lane is the selected reference. Choosing another player as the reference scores
 * them normally: two player renders are a real comparison even when the baked
 * capture is empty.
