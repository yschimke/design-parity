/**
 * Project a `compose/semantics` tree into a **tag index** — `testTag → {count, bounds, space}`.
 *
 * The JavaScript twin of the serve host's `ServeSemanticsTags` (Kotlin). Both exist because the
 * index has two producers and the same consumer contract: the serve host projects it live from a
 * daemon render, and a *published catalog* has no daemon at render time, so its index has to be
 * computed here, at catalog-generation time, and committed beside the stickers.
 *
 * The two implementations must not drift, so every rule below is stated in both and pinned by the
 * shared fixture in `fixtures/tag-index/`. Where they disagree, an element gate resolves a tag
 * differently on the server than in an offline parity run — the precise cross-engine divergence the
 * component-parity contract exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## The rules, and why each is not negotiable
 *
 * - **`count` counts every node carrying the tag**, including nodes whose bounds are unusable. A tag
 *   is only a usable identity while exactly one node carries it, and Compose does not enforce that;
 *   dropping a zero-area duplicate would report `count: 1` for a genuinely ambiguous tag and let a
 *   consumer resolve it as unique. `count` is the whole reason the index exists rather than a plain
 *   `tag → bounds` map.
 * - **`bounds` is the FIRST usable box in depth-first order**, absent when no node carrying the tag
 *   has one. First rather than last because depth-first is the order both engines walk, so "first"
 *   is reproducible where "last" depends on where the duplicate happened to land.
 * - **The key is the tag verbatim.** Blank-or-absent decides omission and nothing else. Compose
 *   matches a `testTag` as the exact string, so trimming would be a second identity rule: `"item"`
 *   and `" item "` would collapse into one entry reporting `count: 2` (false ambiguity) while an
 *   acceptance recording `" item "` found no key at all (false disappearance).
 * - **`space` is on the wire.** Bounds are `boundsInRoot` — absolute-to-root render pixels, the same
 *   space the published sticker is in. The design doc currently says the index publishes bounds
 *   already transformed into an acceptance's canonical plane; neither producer can do that (the
 *   plane is resolved per comparison, from a reference raster and an acceptance record, and neither
 *   producer has one). Until that is settled, each entry names its own space so no consumer can
 *   silently treat these as canonical.
 *
 * Pure and I/O-free — no `@design-parity/*`, no filesystem — so it unit-tests without an `npm ci`,
 * like its siblings `catalog-image-path.mjs` / `catalog-priority.mjs`. The driver does the writing.

 * `previewId` (stamped by `bridgeLivePreviewIds`) keys the bundle's semantics sidecar, and `path`
 * yields the served route id through {@link catalogPreviewId}'s rule. Re-deriving either would be a
 * second naming scheme to keep in step, and a mis-keyed index fails *silently* — every gate simply
 * never resolves.
 *
 * **Only exact pairs are published.** An image `bridgeLivePreviewIds` deliberately left unbridged
 * (a state with no desktop source, or a function the Android-only supplement overrode) gets no
 * entry, and neither does one whose bundle carried no tree. That matters more here than for a
 * vector: bounds are per-variant, so falling back to a sibling variant's tree would publish boxes
 * that describe different pixels, and an element gate would report movement that never happened. An
 * absent entry degrades to "no element gate"; a wrong one produces a wrong verdict.
 *
 * Returns the index plus the counts the driver reports, so a whole bundle silently missing its
 * semantics shows up as a number rather than as an empty file nobody looks at.
