# `fixtures/` — cross-runtime design-artifact fixtures

`parity-issues.json` is emitted in the JavaScript producer's wire format and loaded directly by
`ServeParityIssuesStoreTest`, pinning the producer and Kotlin consumer to the same schema.

The conformance suite for `compose-preview-known-differences/v1`, its generator and the engine it
pins moved to design-parity's
[`@design-parity/known-differences`](https://github.com/yschimke/design-parity/tree/main/packages/known-differences)
package, under `test/conformance/`.

The `.rc` files below are captured Remote Compose documents for the player tests.

Small, committed `.rc` documents the browser-player tests in this directory replay. They are real
captures from the `remote-m3` catalog's render, not hand-written bytes, so a test built on one
exercises exactly the wire form the connector packs into a bundle's `ir/<id>.rc` sidecar. That
catalog is published from [yschimke/wear-m3-catalog](https://github.com/yschimke/wear-m3-catalog)
now (#4588), so re-capturing means rendering it there — see below. The committed fixtures are
unaffected: they are bytes, not a build.

| file | source preview | why it is here |
|---|---|---|
| `watch-screen-round-clip.rc` | `WatchScreenRemote` (454×454, density 2.0) | The catalog's only **size-relative** clip: `RemoteModifier.clip(RemoteCircleShape)` writes each `MODIFIER_ROUNDED_CLIP_RECT` corner as a NaN-encoded expression over the component's measured size rather than a dp literal. Reading those as plain floats produced an empty clip path and a blank canvas ([#2930](https://github.com/yschimke/compose-ai-tools/issues/2930)) — a failure that parses cleanly and warns about nothing, so only a pixel assertion catches it. Used by `rc-round-clip.test.mjs`. |

Re-capture one by rendering the catalog and copying the sidecar:

```sh
# in a yschimke/wear-m3-catalog checkout
./gradlew :remote-catalog:composePreviewRenderAll
cp remote-catalog/build/compose-previews/renders/\
WatchScreenRemote_width_227dp_height_227dp_dpi_320.rc \
  <compose-ai-tools>/scripts/design-artifacts/fixtures/watch-screen-round-clip.rc
```

Or pull it straight off the delivery branch without a build at all — the same document ships as the
sticker's IR sidecar:

```sh
git fetch https://github.com/yschimke/wear-m3-catalog.git design-artifacts/remote-m3
git show FETCH_HEAD:bundle/ir/Template%2FWatchScreen.rc > \
  scripts/design-artifacts/fixtures/watch-screen-round-clip.rc
```

Keep them small — these are checked-in binaries, and a document big enough to be interesting is
already only a couple of kilobytes.

## `IndeterminateCircularProgress-400x400.rc`

The oscillating row from the CMP/Wasm parity lane — a document whose arc sweeps continuously, which
is what makes it the right subject for `rc-cmp-wasm-clock-pin.test.mjs`: two captures taken 1.2 s
apart must be identical when the clock is pinned, and visibly different when it is not.

It used to be read out of `:rc-player-compose`'s test resources. The players moved to
[yschimke/rc-players](https://github.com/yschimke/rc-players), so this is a copy rather than a
cross-repo path — one 1.2 KB document, and a browser test that self-skipped on a missing sibling
checkout would be a silent hole rather than a gate.

Originally taken from the published `remote-m3` bundle; upstream provenance is in that repository's
`rc-player/compose/src/jvmTest/resources/rc-fixtures/README.md`.
