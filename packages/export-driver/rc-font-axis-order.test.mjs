/**
 * rc-font-axis-order.test.mjs — a second document's font-variation axis still reaches the API, and
 * the frame that keeps it is measured in the face that landed.
 *
 * Run with `node --test 'scripts/design-artifacts/*.test.mjs'`.
 *
 * Both defects here were invisible to a per-document test and only appeared in a *catalog* run,
 * which is what `rc-compare.mjs` does: one page, every `ir/*.rc` in turn
 * ([#4177](https://github.com/yschimke/compose-ai-tools/issues/4177)).
 *
 * 1. **The axis request was skipped.** After the weight specimen registered `Roboto Flex` over
 *    `wght`, the page carried a variable face — and "we have a variable face" was read as "the axes
 *    can be applied", so the width specimen's `wdth` request was dropped. Its three lines then drew
 *    from a face pinning `wdth` at 100, i.e. at one width. Document *order* decided it.
 * 2. **The frame was measured in the wrong face.** Fixing (1) exposed it: the text was measured
 *    before the variable face arrived, so the widest line rendered wider than the box measured for
 *    it and was clipped mid-word — `Hamburg · wdth 1`.
 *
 * Hermetic. The stylesheet API is faked over localhost and answers a range request the way css2
 * does — one face declaring the range — served from the repo's own vendored **variable** Roboto
 * Flex. Nothing here touches fonts.googleapis.com, and the ramp it asserts is a property of the
 * file, not of the network.
 *
 * The fixtures are the `remote-m3` catalog's own two specimens, in the order the catalog renders
 * them: `VariableWeightRemote` then `VariableWidthRemote`. Rendering the width one alone passes
 * even against the bug, which is the whole point of pairing them.
