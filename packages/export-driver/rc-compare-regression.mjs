/**
 * rc-compare-regression.mjs — fail a pull request whose player change makes a document render worse.
 *
 * This is the guard that replaced the publish-time pixel gate. The old one enforced an absolute 1%
 * per preview inside the `design-artifacts` publish job — on `main`, after the regression had
 * merged — so it could only ever strand the delivery branch on a stale render, never stop the
 * change. This runs on the pull request, against the change proposing it, and asks the only
 * question a PR can answer: **did this diff move any document?**
 *
 * Two comparisons, both against a baseline produced by the same lane on `main`:
 *
 *   • a document that rendered in the baseline and does not render now — always a failure, whatever
 *     the pixels say;
 *   • a document whose mismatch against the baked reference grew by more than `--max-increase-pp`
 *     percentage points.
 *
 * Deliberately a *delta*, not a bar. Absolute mismatch is dominated by backend differences nobody
 * on this PR introduced (Skia-vs-Android glyph coverage, rasteriser-level outline halos); the
 * number that means something is how much this change moved it. A row that was already
 * at 3% and stays at 3% is somebody else's known divergence — the page reports it. A row that goes
 * 0.26% → 2.17% is this diff, and that is what turns the job red.
 *
 * The corpus is the published `design-artifacts/<system>` bundle rather than a freshly rendered
 * catalog: fixing the documents is what isolates the player. A PR that changes the *catalog* moves
 * numbers for reasons that are not a player regression, and re-rendering the catalog here would
 * both cost an Android render and confuse the signal.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node rc-compare-regression.mjs --baseline <rc-compare-summary.json> \
 *     --current <rc-compare-summary.json> [--max-increase-pp 0.25]
