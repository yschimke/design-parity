/**
 * Build a published catalog's `references/index.json` from the repo's `design-map.json`.
 *
 * The preview server has served design references — the **PNG ↔ Design reference** lane on
 * `/compare`, and the focused Reference / Diff / Actual page behind it — since
 * `ServeDesignReferences.kt` landed, reading a `compose-preview-references/v1` manifest from
 * `references/index.json` on the catalog's delivery branch. Nothing ever *wrote* one: the schema
 * string existed only in the server and its own tests, so `data-has-reference` was `0` on every
 * published catalog and the lane never appeared. This module is the missing producer.
 *
 * It is the join between two id namespaces that were never wired together:
 *
 * - `design-map.json` (design-parity's correspondence file) keys a reference by the **code handle**
 *   `path/File.kt#PreviewFunction`, plus the raw compose-preview discovery `previewId`.
 * - The published catalog keys a sticker by its **route-safe serve preview id**
 *   (`chat-contact__ideal__default__dark__compact`), derived from the image path — see
 *   `ServeCatalogStore.previewIdFor`, restated in [servePreviewId].
 *
 * `catalog.spec.json` is what bridges them: every spec `preview` (and `variants[].preview`) is an
 * exact `@Preview` **function name**, which is also the `#Member` of a design-map code handle. So
 * the mapping is `code handle → function name → spec component + variant slot → catalog image →
 * serve preview id`. Deliberately keyed off the function name rather than the discovery `previewId`,
 * because the discovery id is a rendering detail (it carries the `@Preview` `name=` and gets
 * filename-sanitised on the way into a bundle) while the function name is the stable identity both
 * files already agree on.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (no `@design-parity/*`, no I/O) so it unit-tests without an `npm ci`,
 * like its siblings `catalog-image-path.mjs` / `catalog-variants.mjs`. The rasterising half — turn
 * an HTML/Figma reference into the canonical PNG the server compares — lives in
 * `emit-design-references.mjs`, which drives this.

 * (`catalog.spec.json` carries only cover-sheet fields), so that index comes back empty and every
 * design-map entry warns "matches no published sticker" while the catalog publishes happily around
 * it. The references simply never appear on the delivery branch, and the server's PNG ↔ Design
 * reference lane stays dark.
 *
 * Reintroducing `groups` purely to satisfy this join would restate the whole inventory in JSON —
 * the exact duplication the annotations exist to remove, and a second source of truth that can
 * drift from the first.
 *
 * `previewId` is the better key anyway: it is what the export already stamps on every catalog

 * is exact, where the function-name join needs the spec to say which function owns which sticker.
 *
 * ### Two id namespaces
 *
 * The two sides are NOT written in the same alphabet, and comparing them verbatim silently drops
 * references. A design-map entry records the **raw discovery id** — the one the daemon keys renders
 * on — while a catalog image's `previewId` comes from the bundle manifest, which carries the
 * **sanitised in-bundle form** (`BundleCommand.kt`: "The manifest's previewIds carry the sanitised
 * in-bundle form; the daemon keys renders on the RAW discovery id"). Anything outside
 * `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` becomes `_`, so a `@Preview(name = "Small Round")` is `…_Small Round` in the
 * design-map and `…_Small_Round` in the catalog.
 *
 * So the index is keyed by BOTH forms. An exact hit wins; otherwise the entry's id is sanitised and
 * matched against the same projection. Catalogs whose preview names need no sanitising (`Light` /
 * `Dark`) are unaffected either way — which is exactly why this gap survives casual testing.
