/**
 * Project a repo's **design-page import** onto a published catalog — the producer for the preview
 * server's `/{system}/pages/` surface.
 *
 * A repo imports whole pages of its design file as SVG (m3-catalog's `scripts/import-figma-pages.mjs`
 * is the reference implementation) and commits them under `design/pages/`: one `pages.json` naming
 * the component nodes on each page, and one `<id>.svg` per page exported with `data-node-id` on
 * every element. The server inlines that SVG, finds a node by its id, hides the design's own drawing
 * of it, and puts the catalog's render in the hole — which is why the ids are load-bearing and the
 * export cannot be a raster.
 *
 * The catch is the same one `design-references.mjs` exists to solve: the id on a node is the repo's
 * own **discovery** preview id, and a published catalog keys everything on the route-safe **serve**
 * preview id (`chat-contact__ideal__default__dark__compact`). Handing the manifest to the server
 * unchanged would give it ids that render nothing. So this module re-keys each node, reusing that
 * module's indexes rather than restating the join:
 *
 * 1. **By discovery preview id** ([imagesByPreviewId]) — exact, and the id a design-map entry
 *    already carries to disambiguate light from dark. Handles both id namespaces (raw vs the
 *    sanitised in-bundle form), which is why it is tried first.
 * 2. **By `@Preview` function name** ([imagesByPreviewFunction], via the `#Member` of the code
 *    handle) — the fallback for a spec-led catalog whose manifest entry named no preview id.
 *
 * A node that resolves to neither keeps its `code` and its `link`: the mapping is still true and
 * the outline still names the file, it just can't be drawn with a render. Dropping it instead would
 * silently understate the page's coverage, which is the one number this surface exists to report.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (no I/O) so it unit-tests without an `npm ci`, like its siblings
 * `design-references.mjs` / `catalog-variants.mjs`. The I/O half — read the repo's import, copy the
 * SVGs into the bundle — lives in `emit-design-pages.mjs`.

/**
 * Why this system must NOT publish the imported design pages, or null when it may.
 *
 * A repository's `design-pages.json` is repo-GLOBAL and names one Figma file, but a repository can
 * ship several systems reproducing different kits. Without this, every system published the one
 * kit's sheets: m3-catalog's four systems all served the Material 3 Design Kit's 30 pages and 3,014
 * nodes, and on the two that reproduce a different kit not one node resolved to anything — the
 * re-keying worked perfectly and found nothing, because there was nothing to find
 * (yschimke/m3-catalog#398).
 *
 * The spec already knows the answer: `referenceKits` names the kit this system is compared against.
 * So the rule is a positive match — publish only when the imported pages are keyed to a kit this
 * system actually reproduces — and every other case is a skip:
 *
 * - **no `referenceKits`** — the system reproduces nothing and has no pages of its own. This is the
 *   samples sheets, which map no components at all.
 * - **a different kit** — the wrong sheets, which is the bug this exists to stop.
 * - **no `fileKey`** — the import does not say which kit it came from, so no match can be proven.
 *   A skip rather than a guess: publishing the wrong kit's pages is the failure being fixed, and it
 *   is silent, while a skip says so in the log.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a `--strict` failure at the call site: on a system that correctly reproduces a
 * different kit, skipping IS the right outcome, and failing the build for it would break exactly
 * the repositories this fixes.
