// Evaluate a module's declared render assertions against the data products a render produced.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// A catalog can say WHAT to render, and the visual diff can say whether a render CHANGED. Neither
// can say whether a render is still TRUE to a property the project declared — "every sticker in
// this sheet types in Google Sans Flex", "every scrolling Wear screen shows a position indicator".
//
// That gap is not hypothetical. `:glimmer-catalog` rendered all seven Glimmer type roles at weight
// 400 for its entire life: the axes carrying 520/650/750 were filtered away by
// `Paint.setFontVariationSettings` against a static font instance, silently. It passed the render,
// passed `failOnFallback` (the FAMILY resolved), and passed the visual diff (it was wrong from the
// first render, so nothing changed). Every fact needed to catch it was already on disk —
// `fonts-used.json` named the family, `compose-semantics` carried
// `typography.fontVariationSettings` per text node — and nothing read it against an expectation.
//
// So this asserts over the data products a render ALREADY writes. It never inspects a render
// itself: a new assertable property is a data-product question, answered there, not here.
//
// See issue #5467 for the design and its open questions.
