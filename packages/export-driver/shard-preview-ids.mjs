/**
 * Partition a catalog's discovered preview ids across N parallel render shards.
 *
 * The design-artifacts render is one serial `bundle pack`, and it grows linearly with the preview
 * count. This module decides who renders what when that is split across jobs.
 *
 * **The cost model, re-measured on CI after #3548 (issue #3559).** Both terms come from the same
 * m3-catalog job on `ubuntu-latest`, read off the render step's own task timings:
 *
 *   render_seconds ≈ 100 + 0.39 × previews          (one job, no sharding)
 *
 * against `≈ 104 + 2.55 × previews` before #3548 — same catalog, same runner, four weeks of growth
 * apart. What moved is only the marginal term, and only part of it:
 *
 *   term                     before #3548        after #3548
 *   fixed (configure+compile   104 s               100 s        ← unchanged, and never was 3.7 min
 *     + discover + pack)
 *   composePreviewRender       2.38 s/preview      0.202 s/preview   ← the warm renderer, 12x
 *   semantics capture          0.17 s/preview      0.185 s/preview   ← daemon-driven, untouched
 *
 * so m3-catalog's full sheet went from 2893 s to 543 s (1095 → 1147 previews). The marginal term is
 * now barely twice the semantics pass that #3548 never touched, which is the real ceiling on any
 * further win here.
 *
 * **What that means for the shard count.** A shard's fixed cost is its own job prefix (~25 s) plus
 * its own `compose-preview list --json` discovery (~87 s: configure + compile + discover) plus the
 * render step's Gradle prologue (~20 s) and its upload/cache tail (~15 s) — about **150 s**, again
 * not 3.7 min. So `T_shard ≈ 150 s + 0.39 s × previews/N`, plus a ~85 s merge/generate/publish tail.
 * At m3-catalog's 1147 previews that is 9.1 min serial against 5.8 min at N=4 — three minutes of
 * wall clock for three extra runners, with the serial render sitting at a fifth of its
 * `render-timeout`. **The optimum moved down, exactly as cheaper marginal work with an unchanged
 * fixed cost predicts, and at this size it moved below 2: the catalog ships `render-shards: 1`.**
 * Sharding starts paying again around 3000 previews, and becomes necessary near 6000, where the
 * serial render meets a 2400 s `render-timeout`.
 *
 * Nothing here assumes a particular count — the partition is correct at any N — and the machinery
 * stays because the pressure that motivated it returns with the sheet, not because it is switched
 * on today.
 *
 * The mechanism is exclusion, not selection: each shard runs the SAME `bundle pack` with
 * `--exclude-preview-id <everything that isn't mine>`, which is documented to leave the excluded
 * previews listed in the bundle (addressable, just without a baked PNG). So every shard emits a
 * structurally identical bundle — same `previews.json`, same manifest, same re-render classpath —
 * differing only in which `previews/<id>.*` slots are filled, which is exactly what
 * `compose-preview bundle merge` unions back together.
 *
 * Four decisions worth stating, because each has a wrong-looking-right alternative:
 *
 *  - **Partition by preview id, never by `@Preview` function name.** One function expands to a
 *    30-cell matrix (m3-catalog's icon buttons) while its neighbour expands to two; a name split is
 *    wildly unbalanced, and the slowest shard sets the wall clock.
 *  - **Round-robin over the SORTED id list, not contiguous blocks.** Render cost per preview is not
 *    uniform — a `showSystemUi = true` scaffold costs far more than a 32dp extra-small button — and
 *    ids sort together by group, so contiguous blocks cluster the template-heavy groups into one
 *    shard. Round-robin spreads them. It is not bin-packing, and does not try to be: bin-packing
 *    from recorded per-preview times is only worth it once a straggler actually shows up.
 *  - **Every emitted exclusion is `=`-anchored.** `--exclude-preview-id` matches a plain pattern by
 *    equality OR substring, and ids are hierarchical (`<base>_<variant>`), so a base id is always a
 *    substring of its own fan-out: a shard excluding another shard's `SwitchOn_Light` also deleted
 *    every `SwitchOn_Light_VARIANT_*` it was itself assigned. That cost m3-catalog three quarters of
 *    its renders — 267 captured of 1095 assigned — silently, on a green run, which is why
 *    `render-shards` was pinned back to 1. The asymmetry is the point: substring matching
 *    over-selects harmlessly on the INCLUDE axis and silently deletes work on the EXCLUDE axis, so
 *    it is unusable with any generated id list, which is exactly what a sharder produces. The `=`
 *    prefix (#3561) matches the id exactly. It is emitted here, at the boundary where ids become
 *    CLI patterns, rather than carried through the partition — everything upstream stays plain ids.
 *  - **Deferred ids are removed BEFORE partitioning, then re-excluded in every shard.** A
 *    `modePriority` deferral (issue #2966) and the partition are both expressed as exclusions, so
 *    the naive union would hand deferred ids a share of the partition and leave one shard rendering
 *    fewer previews than the others for no reason. Removing them first means the shards balance
 *    over the set that is actually going to render, and the deferral still applies within each.
 *
 * Planning is only half of it. [verifyShardPlans] checks that the shards agreed on a disjoint
 * cover — their *intent* — and [verifyShardRenders] checks what the merged bundle actually came back
 * with, because a correct partition that renders nothing passes the first check and used to pass the
 * whole run. See [verifyShardRenders] for the run that did exactly that.
 *
 * One axis this cannot balance: a `@PreviewParameter` provider's rows. Discovery emits one id for
 * the parameterized function and the renderer expands the rows later, so such a preview travels
 * whole — it lands in one shard carrying however many rows it expands to. That is correct (the rows
 * must not be split across bundles) but it is the most likely source of a straggler shard.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (node built-ins only) so it unit-tests without an `npm ci`, like its
 * sibling `deferred-preview-ids.mjs`. The CLI wrapper at the bottom only runs when this file is
 * executed directly.

 * The pre-flight emits a positive **function-name** filter when a spec defers a whole entry
 * (`renderFilterPatterns`), and the shard render passes it as `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_composePreview.filter`.
 * Partitioning the *unfiltered* discovery output against that would be a live bug, not a rounding
 * error: a shard whose share happened to be all deferred-function ids would report work to do, then
 * exclude every id the name filter kept — and `composePreviewRender` rejects a selection that
 * renders nothing.

 * Cross-check what the shards actually **captured** against what they planned to render, after the

 * [verifyShardPlans] checks the shards' *intent*: it reads the plans they uploaded and confirms they
 * form a disjoint cover of one agreed discovery set. That is a check of the partition, and it passes
 * whether or not a single preview came back. The failure this repo actually shipped lived entirely
 * on the other side of it — m3-catalog run 31217598543 partitioned 1095 previews correctly across
 * six shards, printed `6 shard(s) cover 1095 preview(s) exactly once`, and merged 267 of them,
 * because each shard's unanchored exclusion list also deleted the `_VARIANT_` fan-out of every id it
 * excluded. **The run was green.** The loss surfaced only as a downstream warning about previews
 * with no static PNG, which reads like a catalogue of PNG-less sheets rather than three quarters of
 * a render going missing.
 *
 * Anchoring the exclusions (#3561) fixed that cause. This closes the *silence*, which is the part
 * that made it expensive: any future path that drops a shard's work — a matcher regression, a
 * mis-emitted pattern, a render that half-failed without failing the step — now fails the run
 * naming the shard and the ids, instead of publishing a thinner catalog on a green tick.
 *
 * The comparison is only meaningful because [capturedIds] means "came back with *some* artifact",
 * not "came back with a PNG" — see `capturedPreviewIds` in `bundle-previews.mjs` for why a
 * PNG-based check would flag every animated capture and token sheet as a loss.
 *
 * **[semanticsRan] is what keeps that reading honest.** The "any artifact" signal leans on the
 * semantics pass to give a raster-less preview *something*, and that pass is best-effort: a missing
 * daemon descriptor, a session that would not open, or an empty capture all leave `bundle pack`
 * exiting 0 with no `.semantics.json` anywhere. A catalog holding a legitimately raster-less preview
 * would then look exactly like one whose shards ate their own work, and this gate would fail a run
 * for a reason that has nothing to do with sharding. So when the caller reports the semantics pass
 * produced nothing (`bundleCapturedSemantics`), the answer is "cannot tell", not "lost": the check
 * passes with the reason recorded in [notes]. It has no teeth in that state, and pretending
 * otherwise would spend the operator's trust on a false alarm — the very thing that made the
 * original bug expensive.
 *
 * **[exemptIds] covers declared per-preview absences.** [semanticsRan] catches a semantics pass that
 * produced nothing at all; the capture is also best-effort *per preview*, so one id's tree can be
 * missing while the rest carry. This matters for a spec's `"capture": "none"` entries and for
 * previews whose discovered captures are all `optional` (for example catalog sheets on the desktop
 * backend, which cannot render them). Passing those ids closes the window without a threshold and
 * without guessing from their names. Required GIF and token-sheet captures still leave their `.gif`
 * or `.catalog.json`, so they remain covered by the artifact check.
 *

// Two modes, one for each end of the matrix.
//
// Plan ONE shard, run inside that shard's own render job:
//   node shard-preview-ids.mjs --previews discovered.json --shards 6 --index 2 \
//     [--exclude-file mode-filter.txt] [--render-filter-file render-filter.txt] \
//     --out exclude.txt --plan-out shard-plan.json
// Writes the newline-delimited `--exclude-preview-id-file` this shard passes to `bundle pack`, and
// a small plan record for the merge-side cross-check. Prints the number of previews this shard
// renders — 0 means "there was nothing left for you", which a caller should treat as "skip the
// render", not as an error.
//
// VERIFY the plans a finished matrix produced, run before merging its bundles:
//   node shard-preview-ids.mjs --verify shard-plan-1.json shard-plan-2.json …
// Exits non-zero, naming the disagreement, if the shards did not between them render exactly the
// discovered set once each.
//
// VERIFY one plan's exclusion-file transport before rendering:
//   node shard-preview-ids.mjs --verify-exclusions shard-plan.json shard-exclude.txt
// This is intentionally invoked through the pinned driver: an older driver that does not implement
// the contract fails on the unknown option rather than silently feeding an old file format to a new
// workflow.
