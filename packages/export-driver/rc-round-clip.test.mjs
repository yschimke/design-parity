/**
 * rc-round-clip.test.mjs — the player's handling of a **size-relative** clip shape.
 *
 * Run with `node --test scripts/design-artifacts/`.
 *
 * `RemoteModifier.clip(RemoteCircleShape)` writes each `MODIFIER_ROUNDED_CLIP_RECT` (opcode 54)
 * corner as a NaN-encoded expression over the component's measured size, not as a dp literal. Read
 * as a plain float that payload collapses to `NaN`, `ctx.roundRect` then ignores the whole radius
 * list, and the `clip()` that follows gets an **empty path** — which hides everything drawn inside
 * the component. The round watch screen replayed as a blank canvas that way (#2930).
 *
 * Why this is a pixel assertion in a real browser rather than a unit test on the modifier: the
 * failure needs the actual Canvas2D semantics (`roundRect`'s non-finite bail-out, and what an empty
 * clip does to later draws) to reproduce at all, and it is silent everywhere else — the document
 * parses, no opcode is unknown, nothing warns. Only the pixels tell you. It exercises the built
 * bundle (`build/vendored-rc-player-js/bundle.js`) for the same reason `rc-webfonts.test.mjs`
 * does: that is the artifact that actually ships, and a stale bundle beside fixed source is exactly
 * the regression worth catching.

 * about 0.001% — well inside the margin that guards against font drift. A weighted child measured
 * at zero width did exactly that. Its text re-wrapped one word per line and each line was then
 * centred about a zero-width box, landing at a negative x outside the component; the canvas still
 * scored 78.8% covered and the document still parsed with no warning.
 *
 * So assert on the draws themselves. The strings catch the re-wrap (a wrapped title arrives as two
 * `fillText` calls, never as one), and the non-negative x catches the centring: both are properties
 * of a correct layout, not of a particular font's metrics, so this stays stable where a pixel
 * comparison of glyphs would not.
