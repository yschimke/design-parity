/**
 * Fold a catalog spec component's `variants` onto its default render.
 *
 * A catalog spec component names one default `preview` plus, optionally, a list
 * of `variants` — each its own `@Preview` function, tagged by one of three axes:
 * a `state` (`pressed`, `focused`, `disabled`, `off`, `unchecked`, …), named
 * `props` (a content axis, e.g. `content: icon+label`), or a `theme`
 * (`light`/`dark`). This helper joins them: the default preview's images stay
 * first (they keep their own `state`, usually `"default"`, so the grid hero is
 * the resting component), and every variant's images are appended, **re-tagged**
 * — a `state` variant replaces `Image.state`, a `props` variant merges onto
 * `Image.props` while keeping the default state, and a `theme` variant replaces
 * `Image.theme` so a screen whose light and dark renders are two separate
 * `@Preview` functions (`FooScreen` + `FooScreenDark`) folds into one component
 * carrying both a `…__light` and a `…__dark` sticker. That pairing is what lets
 * the preview server serve the baked dark PNG for a night-mode browse instead of
 * bumping the request onto the live render daemon — the light/dark render is the
 * point of `@LightDarkPreview`, and this is its multi-function counterpart for
 * previews that already split the two themes across two functions.
 * The result is one sticker whose variants the catalog manifest gives
 * collision-free paths (`images/<id>/ideal__<state>[__theme][__size][__k-v…].png`,
 * the props segment keeping a props-only variant distinct from the default), and
 * that the single-component view can surface as secondary previews.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (no `@design-parity/*`, no I/O) so it unit-tests
 * without an `npm ci`. Consumed by the vendored `catalogFromCandidates` join in
 * `generate-design-catalog.mjs`. Mirrors the `@design-parity/catalog-export`
 * fold so the workflow render matches the parity flow.
 *
 * @param {Array<{state?: string}>} defaultImages the default preview's images.
 * @param {{componentId: string, variants?: Array<{state?: string, props?: Record<string,unknown>, preview: string}>}} component
 *   the spec component (its `variants` drive the fold).
 * @param {Map<string, {images: Array<object>}>} byFunction rendered candidates
 *   keyed by `@Preview` function name.
 * @returns {{ideal: Array<object>, missing: string[], noSticker: string[],
 *   duplicateAxes: Array<{componentId: string, axes: string}>}}
 *   the merged image list, any variant previews that produced no render (as
 *   `"<componentId> [<label>]"` where the label is the variant's state and/or
 *   `k=v` props), so the caller's completeness gate can still refuse a
 *   half-rendered sticker, then — reported separately, NOT as missing — the
 *   render-less variants that declared `"capture": "none"` (see
 *   capture-mode.mjs), and any images that collide on effective output axes (as
 *   `{componentId, axes}`, which [duplicateAxesFailure] turns into the caller's one refusal).
 *
 *   `duplicateAxes` is a REPORT, not a throw, and that is the point (issue #5065). This fold used
 *   to abort on the first colliding component, so a spec with two of them cost one full render
 *   cycle — roughly half an hour on a real import — to learn about the second. Every other problem
 *   here is already accumulated and reported together; a collision is now no different. The fold
 *   deliberately keeps going and appends the colliding image, so the report covers the whole spec:
 *   the caller (`catalogFromCandidates`) refuses the build once, naming every collision, before
 *   `buildCatalog` writes a single PNG. Refusing stays non-negotiable — a collision means
 *   last-write-wins pixels paired with stale manifest metadata, a correctness problem rather than
 *   a coverage one, so it is never folded under `--allow-incomplete`. What changed is only when
 *   the refusal happens and how much it says.
