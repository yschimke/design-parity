 * ([D3](../../docs/design/parity-batches/00-decisions.md#d3--the-score-rebaseline-is-versioned-and-when)),
 * and `format-compare.js` is loaded by four consumers that have nothing to do with acceptances.
 * Importing the resampler from the module that also carries the document ladder, the five gates and

/**
 * The named resampler: an **area average over exact source footprints**, per channel, on
 * non-premultiplied 8-bit RGBA, rounded half-up and clamped.
 *
 * Chosen over anything host-provided because `drawImage`'s filter is not reproducible off-browser
 * and its smoothing quality is implementation-dependent — the same unchanged candidate bytes would
 * otherwise produce different canonical pixels in the two engines and falsely invalidate as
 * `candidate-changed`. An area average needs no kernel radius, no edge-extension rule (a footprint
 * is clipped to the source rectangle and never samples outside it), and reduces to an exact box
 * filter at integer ratios and to nearest-neighbour when upscaling by an integer — so the three
 * cases an implementation is most likely to special-case are all the same arithmetic here.
 *
 * **Not premultiplied**, deliberately: premultiplying and un-premultiplying introduces a rounding
 * step each way that two engines would have to agree on for no benefit, and this contract's
 * artifacts are opaque by construction (a mask is greyscale with no alpha; an accepted candidate is
 * a crop of an already-composited render). Alpha is averaged as an ordinary fourth channel.
 *
 * Accumulate in double precision and round **half-up** (`Math.floor(v + 0.5)`) exactly once, at the
 * end — rounding per contribution is where two implementations drift.

/**
 * {@link resampleArea}'s arithmetic on **premultiplied** colour: the score path's kernel.
 *
 * Same footprints, same exact-integer weights, same single half-up rounding. The one difference is
 * what gets averaged: each source sample's colour is multiplied by its own alpha before it is
 * accumulated, so the output's RGB is `mean(a·c)` and its alpha stays the ordinary `mean(a)`.
 *
 * ## Why the score path needs it and the gate path must not have it
 *
 * Averaging *straight* alpha and compositing afterwards do not commute. On a black ground, the same
 * half-covered white edge scores two different numbers depending only on how the exporter chose to
 * encode it:
 *
 * | encoding | straight average | composited |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | one pixel, white at alpha 128 | `(255,255,255,128)` | 128 |
 * | two pixels, opaque white + transparent black | `(128,128,128,128)` | 64 |
 *
 * Two visually identical exports at different resolutions therefore scored as a mismatch. Both
 * correct orderings — composite each ground then average, or average premultiplied then composite —
 * reduce to the same expression, `mean(a·c) + g·(1 − mean(a))`, which is what this produces once a
 * premultiplied compositor adds the ground's share. It is also what `drawImage` did before the
 * kernel replaced it (a canvas downscales premultiplied), so the live scorer used to get this right
 * by accident of the host.
 *
 * Averaging premultiplied rather than compositing per ground first is the cheaper of the two: one
 * raster per region instead of one per region *per ground*, and the stage rasters the conformance
 * fixtures pin keep their shape. Nothing is ever un-premultiplied, so the round-trip rounding
 * {@link resampleArea} avoids by staying straight is still avoided here.
 *
 * {@link resampleArea} itself stays straight, and this is a separate function rather than a flag on
 * it, because its output is not only scored — `boxCanvas` paints it as the visible panel and the
 * delta map walks it. Premultiplied bytes handed to `putImageData` render dark. The gate path's
 * reasoning is also still sound on its own terms: a mask is greyscale with no alpha and an accepted
 * candidate is a crop of an already-composited render, so nothing there has an alpha to lose.
