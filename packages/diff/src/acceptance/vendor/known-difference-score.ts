/**
 * The separated-plane scoring path — batch 05's half of
 * `compose-preview-known-differences/v1`.
 *
 * [`known-differences.mjs`](./known-differences.mjs) decides every *verdict*: the refusals, the five
 * gates, the status precedence. It deliberately computes no numbers, because
 * [§4](../../docs/design/COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md#the-normative-contract) settles the gates
 * first (I1: every gate resolves before any score is computed) and left the score — and only the
 * score — to this batch. This file is that score: given the surviving union of masks, it reports
 * `raw`, `accepted` and `unaccepted` over one comparison.
 *
 * **The raw finding is never destroyed.** An acceptance does not remove a difference from the
 * report; it moves that difference into `accepted` while `unaccepted` keeps everything else
 * visible, and `raw` goes on measuring the pair as though nothing had been accepted at all. That is
 * the epic requirement the whole model exists for, and it is why `raw` is computed on its own
 * stages rather than reconstructed from the other two.
 *
 * ## What is *not* negotiable here
 *
 * Four invariants from §4 decide the shape of everything below, and each of them rules out a
 * cheaper implementation that looks equivalent:
 *
 * - **I3/I4 — separation precedes every resample, on both inputs.** The masked and unmasked regions
 *   of the reference *and* the candidate are split in their own pixel space first, and each region
 *   is resampled on its own. A single pre-averaged composite would let an accepted difference on one
 *   side of a straddling footprint cancel an opposite unaccepted regression on the other before
 *   scoring ever saw the pixel — the two are opposite in sign and average to the reference.
 * - **I5 — the union is the union of `valid` survivors.** `resolved`, `invalidated` and `refused`
 *   acceptances suppress nothing. Keeping a `resolved` mask would remove its pixels as neighbourhood
 *   candidates for the pixels *around* it, which hides a regression sitting next to the thing that
 *   was just fixed.
 * - **I6 — raw and unaccepted traverse identical stages.** Filtering is not associative, so a
 *   shortcut path for raw makes `raw ≠ unaccepted` even with an empty union, manufacturing a delta
 *   out of nothing. With no surviving mask this file's `unaccepted` is `raw`, bit for bit, and a
 *   fixture pins it.
 * - **I10 — one resample, source → score plane, at the candidate box's dimensions.** The canonical
 *   plane is for the *gates*: it is where a glyph is still a glyph and where the mask and the
 *   accepted candidate are stored. The score draws each region straight from the source image into
 *   the score plane, exactly as `scoreImages` does today, so enabling acceptance never moves a
 *   number by itself.
 *
 * ## The number moves once, deliberately
 *
 * The kernel here is the portable area average, not the host's `drawImage`, so the published parity
 * numbers shift the moment the browser adopts this path — see
 * [D3](parity-batches/00-decisions.md#d3--the-score-rebaseline-is-versioned-and-when). What I10
 * buys is that they do not move a *second* time: the geometry stays one resample from source to
 * score plane at the candidate box's dimensions. The rebaseline is a versioned change of its own,
 * carrying regenerated baselines and a release note and touching no acceptance semantics.
