/**
 * `compose-preview-known-differences/v1` — the committed known-difference contract, as executable
 * rules.
 *
 * Defined in this repo because `serve` is a consumer and the other wire contracts
 * (`compose-preview-references/v1`, `compose-preview-annotations/v1`,
 * `compose-preview-activity/v1`) already live here; `design-parity` and
 * `@design-parity/catalog-export` are the second consumer and the publisher.
 * [`COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md` §4](../../docs/design/COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md#the-normative-contract)
 * is the specification — this file is the reference implementation of it, and the
 * `fixtures/known-differences/` suite is what keeps the two, plus the two engines batch 05 writes,
 * from drifting apart.
 *
 * **What this module decides, and what it deliberately does not.** It decides every *verdict*: the
 * validation refusals, the five gates, the resolution test, the status precedence, and the exact
 * ordering of `validationFailures` (`statuses` is a *map* — it promises one entry per acceptance,
 * not an order). It does **not** compute `raw` / `accepted` / `unaccepted`: those are the separated
 * plane path in [`known-difference-score.mjs`](./known-difference-score.mjs), and the split is the
 * contract's own (I1 — every gate resolves before any score is computed). The seam between the two
 * is `survivingMasks`, the union of the `valid` acceptances' masks: it cannot be formed until the
 * gates have run, and it is the only thing the scorer needs from here.
 *
 * The canonical-plane rasters arrive **already resampled**, as inputs. That is the same seam: the
 * portable resampler is specified (see {@link resampleArea}) and pinned by its own fixture group,
 * but the gate cases pin gate semantics rather than re-deriving the resample in every one of them —
 * so a resampler divergence fails as a resampler divergence, which is the whole point of pinning
 * intermediate stages at all.

/**
 * The budget, versioned with the schema.
 *
 * The ceilings are *inclusive* — a document at exactly 256 acceptances, exactly 128 megapixels,
 * exactly 8192 px on a side, exactly 8 MiB per artifact, exactly 64 MiB of artifacts in total or
 * exactly 640 MiB of peak live raster is legal, and one unit past refuses. A `>=` check would reject
 * both and leave two engines free to disagree about the case in between.
 *
 * `maxRasterBytes` and `maxTotalArtifactBytes` are the two ceilings that are about the *reader*
 * rather than the document, and they exist because the others quietly implied them: a document
 * inside every one of them could still oblige an engine to hold well over a gigabyte, which is a
 * resource decision the caps were making without anyone taking it.
 *
 * `maxRasterBytes` bounds the *decoded* side and is measured by {@link peakRasterBytes} from the
 * declared headers, before a single raster is allocated. `maxTotalArtifactBytes` is its compressed
 * twin, and closes the gap that left: 256 records × 2 artifacts × 8 MiB is four gigabytes of
 * entirely legal compressed bytes, and padding inside the compressed stream is legal — the
 * conformance fixtures do it deliberately — so a 1×1 image padded to 8 MiB contributes about sixteen
 * bytes to `maxRasterBytes` and eight megabytes to a reader that has to hold it.
 *
 * The offline engine escapes that by re-reading from disk (see the preflight pass in
 * {@link evaluateKnownDifferences}: headers one record at a time, retaining nothing). A browser
 * cannot: `readArtifact` is synchronous by design, because the evaluation ladder is a sequence of
 * ordering requirements and threading a promise through it would turn each into a race — so the
 * adapter must fetch ahead and hold what it fetched. Without this ceiling the bound on what it holds
 * was four gigabytes; with it, 64 MiB.
 *
 * **It is summed over every record whose two artifacts the reader answered for**, whatever any later
 * header check says about them. That is deliberately not the `preflightClean` set the pixel budget
 * uses, and the difference is the whole reason this ceiling can be enforced anywhere but here. An
 * adapter deciding what to retain sees a *superset* of `preflightClean` — it has the headers but not
 * the mask-encoding rules or either hash — so a total restricted to clean records is one an adapter
 * can only over-estimate, and over-estimating a ceiling means skipping a body the engine then asks
 * for, which is `artifact-unreadable`: a verdict change, from a planner. Summed over answered reads,
 * the total is a pure function of what round one already saw, so both sides compute the same number.
 * Counting a record the second pass will never re-read over-counts, and over-counting is the safe
 * direction for a ceiling: it refuses a little early rather than holding a little too much.
 *
 * `maxPreflightBytes` is the odd one out and is not a ceiling on anything a document may declare: it
 * is how much of an artifact the reader must serve so the header preflight can reach a verdict. It
 * still has to be *named* for the same reason the others do — a prefix each engine sizes for itself
 * is a prefix two engines disagree about, and they would disagree precisely on the files that put
 * the most in front of their image data. {@link MAX_CONFORMING_HEADER_BYTES} is the proof that 4 KiB
 * is enough: a conforming artifact resolves the preflight within 1089 bytes, so the constant is
 * chosen with room to spare rather than fitted to the fixtures.

 * @param readArtifact `(path, options) => Uint8Array | { bytes, byteLength } | null | { error }`,
 *   where `path` is relative to the fixed `.design-parity/known-differences/` root (`<id>/<mask>`).
 *   `null` means the fetch or open failed, which is `artifact-unreadable`; a file that opens and
 *   holds too few bytes for an `IHDR` is `header-invalid`, because the line is where the failure
 *   occurs rather than how little data there turned out to be.
 *
 *   **`options` is `{ prefix: N }` on the header pass and absent on the decode pass**, and the
 *   difference is the whole reason the preflight can be called bounded. Asked for a prefix, the
 *   reader serves **at most** the first `N` bytes as `{ bytes, byteLength }`, where `byteLength` is
 *   the size of the whole file — which it knows from a `stat` or a `Content-Length` before any bytes
 *   exist. Serving the entire artifact and letting this module read only the front of it satisfies
 *   the letter of "walk chunk headers" while allocating the 8 MiB the budget exists to avoid, twice
 *   per record, for every record that reaches the preflight. A reader may serve fewer than `N` bytes
 *   only because the file is shorter; it may never serve more.
 *
 *   `byteLength` rather than `bytes.length` is what the byte cap and the second-read comparison are
 *   both measured against, so both keep asking a question about the artifact instead of a question
 *   about how much of it was read. A plain `Uint8Array` is still accepted — for the decode pass,
 *   where the whole file is the answer — and its length stands in for both.
 *
 *   **The reader carries three further obligations this module cannot discharge for it**, and
 *   returns `{ error }` to report the first two without materialising the file:
 *
 *   - `{ error: "artifact-too-large" }` — the reader must refuse to allocate more than
 *     {@link BUDGET}`.maxArtifactBytes`. Handing back a whole oversized file so this module can
 *     measure its `.length` exhausts the process through the very guard meant to prevent that, and
 *     only the reader is positioned to know the size before the bytes exist. Every other budget is
 *     enforced from a bounded header read for exactly this reason; this one had been left to a
 *     check that arrives too late.
 *   - `{ error: "path-not-contained" }` — the grammar here is *lexical*, so it cannot see a symlink
 *     inside an acceptance directory. Whether the resolved path stays inside **this acceptance's own
 *     `<id>/` directory** — not merely somewhere under `known-differences/` — is a fact about the
 *     filesystem or the URL space the reader is serving from, and it must establish it before
 *     opening anything. The narrower bound is the load-bearing one: a link from one acceptance's
 *     directory into another's stays under the root while letting a record read bytes it does not
 *     own, and the hash it is then checked against is the *other* record's.
 *   - **Resolution is exact-case, including the `<id>` directory.** A document spelling `MASK.png`
 *     for a committed `mask.png` opens and evaluates on a case-insensitive Windows or macOS
 *     filesystem and is `artifact-unreadable` on a Linux checkout or a case-sensitive URL space — the
 *     same host-versus-checkout divergence the portable grammar and the case-folded id scan close
 *     from the other side, and one no lexical rule can see, because it is a fact about which bytes
 *     the reader actually opened. A reader whose filesystem resolves the request case-insensitively
 *     must compare the resolved name against the requested one and report the mismatch as a failed
 *     open (`null`) rather than serving the file it happened to find.
 * @param comparison the comparison being evaluated, or `null` for a validation-only pass.
 * @param catalog `{ previews: [{ system, id, component, variant, referenceIds }] }` for the
 *   orphaned-target walk, or `null` to skip it.
 * @returns `{ statuses, survivingMasks, validationFailures }`. `statuses` is **absent** for a
 *   document-level rejection — "no acceptance was evaluated" and "every acceptance was valid" must
 *   not serialise the same way — and `survivingMasks` is absent with it. `survivingMasks` carries
 *   the decoded canonical-plane mask of every acceptance whose status is `valid`, in input order:
 *   it is the union
 *   [`known-difference-score.mjs`](./known-difference-score.mjs) suppresses, and forming it is the
 *   one thing that has to happen after the gates and before the score (I5).

 *
 * 1. **Does any object repeat a member name?** RFC 8259 leaves that undefined and runtimes genuinely
 *    differ — V8 keeps the last value, several keep the first, strict parsers refuse the input — so
 *    `{"id":"safe","id":".."}` addresses two different artifact directories from one committed file.
 *    Names are unescaped through `JSON.parse` before comparison, because `"id"` and `"\u0069d"` are
 *    the same member and only one of the two spellings looks like a duplicate.
 * 2. **Is an integer-valued field written as a non-integer?** `Number.isSafeInteger` cannot see it:
 *    `9007199254740991.1` has already been rounded to `…991` by the time it reaches a check, and so
 *    has `2.00000000000000000001` to `2` — so this engine accepts what a lossless consumer, or a
 *    Kotlin `Int` decoder, refuses. No bound closes the hole: at any magnitude some fractional
 *    literal is nearer to an integer than the spacing of doubles there. So the token is checked as
 *    written, at the paths where an integer is required — a box's `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` and an

  // arbitrary-precision integers: a ratio happens to fix the familiar `0.145 × 200` boundary, but
  // diverges again at schema-valid safe-integer bounds (pinned by the large-products fixture).
  const minDimension = Math.min(baseline.width, baseline.height);
  // **Exact integer arithmetic, in `BigInt`.** `element.tolerance` is spelled as a plain decimal
  // with at most six fraction digits, so it is an exact multiple of `1 / SCALE` and scaling recovers
  // that multiple exactly. The comparison is then a product on each side, and those products are
  // *not* safely representable as doubles — which is the whole reason they are `BigInt` here.
  //
  // An earlier revision of this line asserted they were, on the grounds that `minDimension` is
  // bounded by the 8192 axis cap. **That was wrong.** The axis cap constrains raster headers;
  // `$defs.box` permits an element baseline up to `9007199254740991`, and nothing ties the two
  // together. With `tolerance: 0.000011`, `minDimension: 9007199254727272` and a displacement of
  // `99079191802`, the exact left side exceeds the right by 8 — but both products round to the same
  // double, so the comparison answered `valid` for an element that had moved. That is worse than
  // the ratio form it replaced, which answers `element-moved` on the same input.
  //
  // The magnitudes are bounded by the safe-integer range on the way in (`isBox` checks the fields
  // *and* the far edges), so these `BigInt`s are small and fixed-width; nothing here is proportional
  // to a token, and there is no exponent to bomb.
  //
  // The ratio form that preceded both is exact only where the double happens to be: `0.145 × 200`
  // is `28.999999999999996`, so a displacement of exactly 29 — the inclusive boundary — reported
  // `element-moved` under a scaled tolerance and `valid` under a decimal consumer. And it made the
  // verdict depend on a spelling the parse had destroyed: `0.144999999999999999999` is strictly
  // below `0.145` as a decimal and exactly `0.145` as a double. The grammar removes that spelling;
  // this removes the arithmetic that could not represent the comparison.
