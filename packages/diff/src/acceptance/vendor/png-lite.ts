/**
 * A dependency-free, **host-free** PNG reader, sized to exactly what the known-difference contract
 * needs.
 *
 * Host-free since batch 05: no `node:zlib`, no `node:crypto`, nothing a browser lacks — see
 * [`inflate-lite.mjs`](./inflate-lite.mjs) and [`sha256-lite.mjs`](./sha256-lite.mjs). That is not
 * tidiness. The acceptance engine in `format-compare.js` and the offline one must decode the same
 * bytes the same way, and the browser's only other decode path is an `<img>` onto a canvas, which
 * normalises every colour type to 8-bit RGBA and so cannot see the encoding rules
 * [§4](../../docs/design/COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md#the-normative-contract) spends a section on.
 * The **writer** lives in [`png-write.mjs`](./png-write.mjs), which does need a compressor and is
 * Node-only; only the fixture generator writes a PNG.
 *
 * `pngjs` is already a driver dependency and is *not* what this is for. Two reasons, both from
 * [`COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md` §4](../../docs/design/COMPONENT_PARITY_WORKFLOW.md#the-normative-contract):
 *
 * 1. **The contract's preflight is a header walk, not a decode.** It reads `IHDR`, takes
 *    `width × height` from it, checks the two bytes after them, and walks chunk *headers* to the
 *    first `IDAT` looking for `acTL` — never a chunk's data, never an allocation sized by the file,
 *    and over a 4 KiB *prefix* of the artifact rather than the whole of it. A library decode
 *    allocates the oversized raster to measure it, which defeats the budget at the moment it is
 *    supposed to fire — and so, more quietly, does reading the whole file to look at its first
 *    kilobyte. {@link preflightPng} is that walk and nothing more.
 * 2. **The fixtures need files a well-behaved encoder refuses to write** — an APNG, a palette mask
 *    with strictly binary samples, a header that lies about its dimensions, a truncated file. Those
 *    are the cases a sample-only or decode-only check accepts, so the suite is worthless without
 *    them, and {@link buildPng} plus `png-write.mjs` exist to author them deliberately.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: bit depth 8, no interlacing, single `IDAT`. Anything else is a
 * decode failure rather than a feature, which is also the verdict the contract wants for it.

 *
 * So the padding goes *inside* the compressed stream, where it is legal and inert:

 * - an **empty stored deflate block** — `00 00 00 FF FF`, `BFINAL=0`, `BTYPE=00`, `LEN=0` — costs

 *   Inserted straight after the two-byte zlib header, before the original block, so the Adler-32
 *   trailer (which covers the *uncompressed* bytes) is untouched.
 * - a **zero-length `IDAT` chunk** costs twelve, contributes nothing to the stream, and keeps the
 *   `IDAT` run contiguous.
 *
 * Five and twelve are coprime, so every padding of 44 bytes or more is reachable exactly (43 is the
 * Frobenius number of the pair, and the sizes here are megabytes). The

/**
 * Put every pixel on the one straight-alpha spelling a premultiplied canvas can hand back.
 *
 * A browser stores canvas pixels **premultiplied** at 8 bits and unpremultiplies them on readback,
 * so a straight-alpha colour is quantised to whichever of the `a + 1` premultiplied values its
 * channel lands on and then re-expanded. Two distinct committed colours therefore compare *equal*
 * in the browser engine and *unequal* under a decoder that preserves the channels it was given —
 * and the match metric charges all four channels (D5 answer 6), so the difference lands straight in
 * the candidate gate as a spurious `candidate-changed`. The extreme case is alpha `1`, where the
 * whole 0–255 range collapses onto two representable colours: every channel below 128 reads back
 * as `0` and every channel at or above it as `255`, a hidden difference of up to 254 that no
 * `candidateTolerance` in `[0, 8]` can absorb.
 *
 * The fix `v1` takes is to define the round trip **once, here**, rather than to forbid partial alpha
 * — refusing it would need a new reason token and would still only half-close the hole, since the
 * canonical rasters a comparison supplies come from the same decode path.
 *
 *     p = floor(c × a / 255 + 0.5)            premultiply, round half-up
 *     c' = floor(p × 255 / a + 0.5)           unpremultiply, round half-up
 *
 * **The property that makes it cross-engine, stated exactly.** It is *not* that a normalised pixel
 * is a fixed point of the host's round trip — it is not, if the host breaks a tie the other way on
 * the unpremultiply. It is that normalising **after** the host has had its turn lands on the same
 * value as normalising instead of it: `N(host(c)) = N(c)`, for any host that rounds to *a* nearest
 * integer in both directions, whatever it does with ties. Two steps prove it. Premultiplying has no
 * ties at all — `c × a / 255` is a half-integer only if `2 c a ≡ 255 (mod 510)`, and the left side
 * is even while `255` is odd — so every host agrees on `p`. Unpremultiplying may then differ by one,
 * but the value it returns is within `0.5` of `p × 255 / a`, so premultiplying *that* is within
 * `0.5 × a / 255 < 0.5` of `p` for every `a < 255` and re-lands on the same `p`; `a = 255` makes the
 * whole map the identity. So the browser normalises what it read back, the offline decoder
 * normalises what it decoded, and both arrive at the one spelling of that premultiplied bucket
 * without either having to reproduce the other's tie-break.
 *
 * **So it must be applied to every raster that reaches a comparison, not only to decoded PNGs.** A
 * canonical raster the browser lifted off a canvas has already been through `host(·)`; the same
 * raster read from a file offline has not. Normalising both is what makes them the same pixels.
 *
 * Alpha `0` is the degenerate case of the same rule — `p` is `0` for every channel and nothing can
 * be recovered from it — so it normalises to zero RGB, as it did when that was the only case
 * handled here. Alpha `255` is the identity and is skipped rather than computed, because it is
 * almost every pixel this contract sees.
